# Mise Mission and Product Vision

## Mission Statement

**Mise exists to eliminate development environment complexity and enable developers to focus on building great software.**

Mise serves as "the front-end to your dev env" by unifying three critical aspects of development workflow:
1. **Tool management** - Ensuring the right versions of languages, frameworks, and CLI tools
2. **Environment management** - Providing project-specific configuration and variables  
3. **Task automation** - Streamlining build, test, and deployment processes

## Core Product Vision

### The Problem We Solve

**Development Environment Hell**: Developers waste countless hours dealing with:
- Version conflicts between projects ("works on my machine")
- Complex tool installation and management across platforms
- Inconsistent environments between development, CI, and production
- Fragmented tooling (separate tools for languages, env vars, tasks)
- Slow context switching between projects with different requirements

### Our Solution Philosophy

**Unified Developer Experience**: One tool that replaces the need for:
- Language version managers (nvm, pyenv, rbenv, etc.)
- Environment managers (direnv, dotenv)
- Task runners (make, npm scripts, rake)
- Manual tool installation and PATH management

**Performance First**: 
- Real binaries, not shims (faster execution)
- Parallel operations wherever possible
- Efficient caching and lazy loading
- Minimal runtime overhead

**Developer Ergonomics**:
- Zero-configuration for common workflows
- Automatic tool detection and switching
- Rich CLI experience with helpful error messages
- Seamless integration with existing workflows

## Target Users and Use Cases

### Primary Users

1. **Individual Developers**
   - Managing multiple projects with different tool versions
   - Avoiding "dependency hell" and version conflicts
   - Streamlining local development setup

2. **Development Teams**
   - Ensuring consistent environments across team members
   - Simplifying onboarding for new team members
   - Reducing "works on my machine" issues

3. **DevOps/Platform Teams**
   - Standardizing tooling across CI/CD pipelines
   - Managing tool versions in production environments
   - Enabling reproducible builds

### Key Use Cases

**Multi-Language Projects**
```bash
# One command to set up entire stack
mise use node@20 python@3.12 go@latest terraform@1.5
```

**Project Onboarding**
```bash
# New team member runs one command
git clone repo && cd repo && mise install
```

**CI/CD Integration**
```yaml
- name: Setup tools
  run: mise install && mise run ci
```

**Environment-Specific Configuration**
```toml
[env.development]
DATABASE_URL = "postgres://localhost/myapp_dev"

[env.production] 
DATABASE_URL = "postgres://prod-server/myapp"
```

## Product Strategy

### Core Principles

1. **Backwards Compatibility**: Seamless migration from existing tools (asdf, direnv, make)
2. **Ecosystem Integration**: Work with existing package managers and registries
3. **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across macOS, Linux, and Windows
4. **Open Source**: Community-driven with transparent development
5. **Performance**: Fast enough for interactive use, reliable for automation
