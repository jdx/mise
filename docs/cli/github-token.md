Set up a GitHub token to increase API rate limits

This command helps you set up a GitHub personal access token for use with mise.
It will open your browser to the token creation page and guide you through
creating a token with no scopes (which is sufficient for API rate limits).

Examples:

```
$ mise github-token
# Opens browser to create a token, then prompts you to paste it
```

How it works:

This command helps you set up a GitHub personal access token to increase your API rate limits.
It will open your browser to the GitHub token creation page where you can create a token
with no scopes (which is sufficient for API rate limits). After creating the token,
paste it into the prompt and it will be saved to your global mise config file.

The token will be available when mise is activated in your shell.
