# `mise upgrade`

- **Usage**: `mise upgrade [FLAGS] [INSTALLED_TOOL@VERSION]…`
- **Aliases**: `up`
- **Source code**: [`src/cli/upgrade.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/cli/upgrade.rs)

Upgrades outdated tools

By default, this keeps the range specified in mise.toml. So if you have node@20 set, it will
upgrade to the latest 20.x.x version available. See the `--bump` flag to use the latest version
and bump the version in mise.toml.

This will update mise.lock if it is enabled, see <https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#lockfile>

## Arguments

### `[INSTALLED_TOOL@VERSION]…`

Tool(s) to upgrade
e.g.: node@20 python@3.10
If not specified, all current tools will be upgraded

## Flags

### `-i --interactive`

Display multiselect menu to choose which tools to upgrade

### `-j --jobs <JOBS>`

Number of jobs to run in parallel
[default: 4]

### `-l --bump`

Upgrades to the latest version available, bumping the version in mise.toml

For example, if you have `node = "20.0.0"` in your mise.toml but 22.1.0 is the latest available,
this will install 22.1.0 and set `node = "22.1.0"` in your config.

It keeps the same precision as what was there before, so if you instead had `node = "20"`, it
would change your config to `node = "22"`.

### `-n --dry-run`

Just print what would be done, don't actually do it

### `-x --exclude… <INSTALLED_TOOL>`

Tool(s) to exclude from upgrading
e.g.: go python

### `--before <BEFORE>`

Only upgrade to versions released before this date

Supports absolute dates like "2024-06-01" and relative durations like "90d" or "1y".
This can be useful for reproducibility or security purposes.

This only affects fuzzy version matches like "20" or "latest".
Explicitly pinned versions like "22.5.0" are not filtered.

### `--dry-run-code`

Like --dry-run but exits with code 1 if there are outdated tools

This is useful for scripts to check if tools need to be upgraded.

### `--raw`

Directly pipe stdin/stdout/stderr from plugin to user Sets --jobs=1

Examples:

```
# Upgrades node to the latest version matching the range in mise.toml
$ mise upgrade node

# Upgrades node to the latest version and bumps the version in mise.toml
$ mise upgrade node --bump

# Upgrades all tools to the latest versions
$ mise upgrade

# Upgrades all tools to the latest versions and bumps the version in mise.toml
$ mise upgrade --bump

# Just print what would be done, don't actually do it
$ mise upgrade --dry-run

# Upgrades node and python to the latest versions
$ mise upgrade node python

# Upgrade all tools except go
$ mise upgrade --exclude go

# Show a multiselect menu to choose which tools to upgrade
$ mise upgrade --interactive
```
