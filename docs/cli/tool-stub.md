# `mise tool-stub`

- **Usage**: `mise tool-stub <FILE> [ARGS]…`
- **Source code**: [`src/cli/tool_stub.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/cli/tool_stub.rs)

Execute a tool stub

Tool stubs are executable files containing TOML configuration that specify which tool to run and how to run it. They provide a convenient way to create portable, self-contained executables that automatically manage tool installation and execution.

A tool stub consists of: - A shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env -S mise tool-stub - TOML configuration specifying the tool, version, and options - Optional comments describing the tool's purpose

Example stub file: #!/usr/bin/env -S mise tool-stub # Node.js v20 development environment

tool = "node" version = "20.0.0" bin = "node"

The stub will automatically install the specified tool version if missing and execute it with any arguments passed to the stub.

## Arguments

### `<FILE>`

Path to the TOML tool stub file to execute

The stub file must contain TOML configuration specifying the tool and version to run. At minimum, it should specify a 'version' field. Other common fields include 'tool', 'bin', and backend-specific options.

### `[ARGS]…`

Arguments to pass to the tool

All arguments after the stub file path will be forwarded to the underlying tool. Use '--' to separate mise arguments from tool arguments if needed.
