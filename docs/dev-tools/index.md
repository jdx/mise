# Dev Tools

_Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages dev tools like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](/plugins)._

New developer? Try reading the [Beginner's Guide](https://dev.to/jdxcode/beginners-guide-to-rtx-ac4) for a gentler introduction.

mise is a tool for managing programming language and tool versions. For example, use this to install
a particular version of Node.js and ruby for a project. Using `mise activate`, you can have your
shell automatically switch to the correct node and ruby versions when you `cd` into the project's
directory. Other projects on your machine can use a different set of versions.

mise is inspired by [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) and uses asdf's vast [plugin ecosystem](https://github.com/rtx-plugins/registry)
under the hood. However, it is _much_ faster than asdf and has a more friendly user experience.
For more on how mise compares to asdf, [see below](./comparison-to-asdf).

mise can be configured in many ways. The most typical is by `.mise.toml`, but it's also compatible
with asdf `.tool-versions` files. It can also use idiomatic version files like `.node-version` and
`.ruby-version`. See [Configuration](/configuration) for more.

* Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](/configuration#env---arbitrary-environment-variables) for different project directories.
* Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## How it works

mise hooks into your shell (with `mise activate zsh`) and sets the `PATH`
environment variable to point your shell to the correct runtime binaries. When you `cd` into a
directory containing a `.tool-versions`/`.mise.toml` file, mise will automatically set the
appropriate tool versions in `PATH`.

::: info
mise does not modify "cd". It actually runs every time the prompt is _displayed_.
See the [FAQ](/faq#what-does-mise-activate-do).
:::

After activating, every time your prompt displays it will call `mise hook-env` to fetch new
environment variables.
This should be very fast. It exits early if the directory wasn't changed or `.tool-versions`/`.mise.toml` files haven't been modified.

Unlike asdf which uses shim files to dynamically locate runtimes when they're called, mise modifies
`PATH` ahead of time so the runtimes are called directly. This is not only faster since it avoids
any overhead, but it also makes it so commands like `which node` work as expected. This also
means there isn't any need to run `asdf reshim` after installing new runtime binaries.

You should note that mise does not directly install these tools.
Instead, it leverages plugins to install runtimes.
See [plugins](/plugins) below.

## Common commands

Here are some of the most important commands when it comes to working with dev tools.

### `mise use`

For some users, `mise use` might be the only command you need to learn. It will do the following:

- Install the tool's plugin if needed
- Install the specified version
- Set the version as active (it's in PATH)

`mise use node@20` will install the latest version of node-20 and create/update the .tool-versions/.mise.toml
config file in the local directory. Anytime you're in that directory, that version of node will be used.

`mise use -g node@20` will do the same but update the global config (~/.config/mise/config.toml) so
unless there is a config file in the local directory hierarchy, node-20 will be the default version for
the user.

### `mise install`

`mise install` will install but not activate toolsâ€”meaning it will download/build/compile the tool
into `~/.local/share/mise/installs` but you won't be able to use it without "setting" the version
in a `.tool-versions` or `.mise-toml` file.

::: tip
If you're coming from asdf, there is no need to also run `mise plugin add` to first install
the plugin, that will be done automatically if needed. Of course, you can manually install plugins
if you wish or you want to use a plugin not in the default registry.
:::

There are many ways it can be used:

* `mise install node@20.0.0` - install a specific version
* `mise install node@20` - install the latest version matching this prefix
* `mise install node` - install whatever version of node currently specified in .tool-versions/.mise.toml
* `mise install` - install all plugins and tools

### `mise local|global` <Badge type="danger" text="not recommended" />

`mise local` and `mise global` are command which only modify the `.tool-versions` or `.mise.toml` files.
These are hidden from the CLI help and remain for asdf-compatibility. The recommended approach is
to use `mise use` instead because that will do the same thing but also install the tool if it does
not already exists.

### `mise exec`|`mise x`

`mise x` can be used for one-off commands using specific tools. e.g.: if you want to run a script with python3.12:

```sh
mise x python@3.12 -- ./myscript.py
```

Python will be installed if it is not already. `mise x` will read local/global `.tool-versions`/`.mise-toml` files
as well, so if you don't want to use `mise activate` or shims you can use mise by just prefixing commands with
`mise x --`:

```sh
$ mise use node@20
$ mise x -- node -v
20.x.x
```

::: tip
If you use this a lot, an alias can be helpful:

```sh
alias mx="mise x --"
```

:::

Similarly, `mise run` can be used to [execute tasks](/tasks/) which will also activate the mise environment with all of your tools.

## Tool Options

mise plugins may accept configuration in the form of tool options specified in `mise.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
# send arbitrary options to the plugin, passed as:
# MISE_TOOL_OPTS__FOO=bar
mytool = { version = '3.10', foo = 'bar' }
```

Unfortunately at the time of this writing, it's not possible to specify this via the CLI in `mise use` or other commands though. See <https://github.com/jdx/mise/issues/2309>
