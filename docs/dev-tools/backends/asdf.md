# asdf Backend

asdf is the original backend for mise. It relies on asdf plugins for each tool. asdf plugins are more risky to use
because they're typically written by a single developer unrelated to the tool vendor they also do not function on
Windows. Because of the extra complexity of asdf tools and security concerns we are actively moving tools in the
registry away from asdf where possible to backends like aqua and ubi which don't require plugins. That said, not all
tools can function with ubi/aqua if they have a unique installation process or need to set env vars other than PATH.
