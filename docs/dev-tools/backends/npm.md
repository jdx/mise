# npm Backend <Badge type="warning" text="experimental" />

You may install packages directly from [npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/) even if there
isn't an asdf plugin for it.

The code for this is inside of the mise repository at [`./src/backend/npm.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/npm.rs).

## Dependencies

This relies on having `npm` installed. You can install it with or without mise.
Here is how to install `npm` with mise:

```sh
mise use -g node
```

## Usage

The following installs the latest version of [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)
and sets it as the active version on PATH:

```sh
$ mise use -g npm:prettier
$ prettier --version
3.1.0
```

The version will be set in `~/.config/mise/config.toml` with the following format:

```toml
[tools]
"npm:prettier" = "latest"
```
