# SPM Backend <Badge type="warning" text="experimental" />

You may install executables managed by [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager) directly from Github releases.

The code for this is inside of the mise repository at [`./src/backend/spm.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/spm.rs).

## Dependencies

This relies on having `swift` installed. You can install it according to the [instructions](https://www.swift.org/install).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Xcode installed and selected in your system via `xcode-select`, Swift is already available through the toolchain embedded in the Xcode installation.

## Usage

The following installs the latest version of `tuist`
and sets it as the active version on PATH:

```sh
$ mise use -g spm:tuist/tuist
$ tuist --help
OVERVIEW: Generate, build and test your Xcode projects.

USAGE: tuist <subcommand>
...
```

The version will be set in `~/.config/mise/config.toml` with the following format:

```toml
[tools]
"spm:tuist/tuist" = "latest"
```
