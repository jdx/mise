# SPM Backend <Badge type="warning" text="experimental" />

You may install executables managed by [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager) directly from GitHub or GitLab releases.

The code for this is inside of the mise repository at [`./src/backend/spm.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/spm.rs).

## Dependencies

This relies on having `swift` installed. You can either install it [manually](https://www.swift.org/install) or [with mise](/lang/swift).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Xcode installed and selected in your system via `xcode-select`, Swift is already available through the toolchain embedded in the Xcode installation.

## Usage

The following installs the latest version of `tuist`
and sets it as the active version on PATH:

```sh
$ mise use -g spm:tuist/tuist
$ tuist --help
OVERVIEW: Generate, build and test your Xcode projects.

USAGE: tuist <subcommand>
...
```

The version will be set in `~/.config/mise/config.toml` with the following format:

```toml
[tools]
"spm:tuist/tuist" = "latest"
```

### Supported Syntax

| Description                                   | Usage                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub shorthand for latest release version   | `spm:tuist/tuist`                               |
| GitHub shorthand for specific release version | `spm:tuist/tuist@4.15.0`                        |
| GitHub url for latest release version         | `spm:https://github.com/tuist/tuist.git`        |
| GitHub url for specific release version       | `spm:https://github.com/tuist/tuist.git@4.15.0` |

Other syntax may work but is unsupported and untested.

## Tool Options

The following [tool-options](/dev-tools/#tool-options) are available for the backend â€” these
go in `[tools]` in `mise.toml`.

### `provider`

Set the provider type to use for fetching assets and release information. Either `github` or `gitlab` (default is `github`).
Ensure the `provider` is set to the correct type if you use shorthand notation and `api_url` for self-hosted repositories
as the type probably cannot be derived correctly from the URL.

```toml
[tools]
"spm:patricklorran/ios-settings" = { version = "latest", provider = "gitlab" }
```

### `api_url`

Set the URL for the provider's API. This is useful when using a self-hosted instance.

```toml
[tools]
"spm:acme/my-tool" = { version = "latest", provider = "gitlab", api_url = "https://gitlab.acme.com/api/v4" }
```
