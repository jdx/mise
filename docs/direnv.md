# direnv

[direnv](https://direnv.net) and mise both manage environment variables based on directory. Because
they both analyze
the current environment variables before and after their respective "hook" commands are run, they
can sometimes conflict with each other.

If you have an issue, it's likely to do with the ordering of PATH. This means it would
really only be a problem if you were trying to manage the same tool with direnv and mise. For
example,
you may use `layout python` in an `.envrc` but also be maintaining a `.tool-versions` file with
python
in it as well.

A more typical usage of direnv would be to set some arbitrary environment variables, or add
unrelated
binaries to PATH. In these cases, mise will not interfere with direnv.

## mise inside of direnv (`use mise` in `.envrc`)

::: warning
Update 2024-01-21: after `use mise` has been out for a while, the general impression I have is that
while it technically functions fine,
not many people use it because the DX is notably worse than either switching to mise entirely
or using `mise activate` alongside direnv.

The project direction of mise has changed since this was written and the new direction is for it
to be capable of replacing direnv completely for any use-case. This likely won't end up as a drop-in
replacement for direnv like with asdf, but solving the same problems in different ways.
See [environments](/environments.html)
for more details.

I have had virtually no reports of problems with `use mise` in the year it has been out.
This could be because virtually is using it, or it has been surprisingly stable. I genuinely
don't know which. If you try it or use it regularly let me know.

While I have no immediate plans or reasons to do this now, I could see this functionality being
the target of a future deprecation. Not because it's a maintenance burden, but because it just
hasn't
seemed like a particularly useful solution and it may help focus mise on the functionality that does
work for users.
:::

If you do encounter issues with `mise activate`, or just want to use direnv in an alternate way,
this is a simpler setup that's less likely to cause issuesâ€”at the cost of functionality.

This may be required if you want to use direnv's `layout python` with mise. Otherwise there are
situations where mise will override direnv's PATH. `use mise` ensures that direnv always has
control.

To do this, first use `mise` to build a `use_mise` function that you can use in `.envrc` files:

```sh
mise direnv activate > ~/.config/direnv/lib/use_mise.sh
```

Now in your `.envrc` file add the following:

```sh
use mise
```

direnv will now call mise to export its environment variables. You'll need to make sure to
add `use_mise`
to all projects that use mise (or use direnv's `source_up` to load it from a subdirectory). You can
also add `use mise` to `~/.config/direnv/direnvrc`.

Note that in this method direnv typically won't know to refresh `.tool-versions` files
unless they're at the same level as a `.envrc` file. You'll likely always want to have
a `.envrc` file next to your `.tool-versions` for this reason. To make this a little
easier to manage, I encourage _not_ actually using `.tool-versions` at all, and instead
setting environment variables entirely in `.envrc`:

```sh
export MISE_NODE_VERSION=20.0.0
export MISE_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
```

Of course if you use `mise activate`, then these steps won't have been necessary and you can use
mise
as if direnv was not used.

If you continue to struggle, you can also try using the [shims method](dev-tools/shims.md).

### Do you need direnv?

While making mise compatible with direnv is, and will always be a major goal of this project, I also
want mise to be capable of replacing direnv if needed. This is why mise includes support for
managing
env vars and [virtualenv](lang/python.md#automatic-virtualenv-activation)
for python using `.mise.toml`.
