# Environments

Use mise to specify environment variables used for different projects.

To get started, create a `mise.toml` file in the root of your project directory:

```toml [mise.toml]
[env]
NODE_ENV = 'production'
```

To clear an env var, set it to `false`:

```toml [mise.toml]
[env]
NODE_ENV = false # unset a previously set NODE_ENV
```

You can also use the CLI to get/set env vars:

```sh
mise set NODE_ENV=development
# mise set NODE_ENV
# development

mise set
# key       value        source
# NODE_ENV  development  mise.toml

cat mise.toml
# [env]
# NODE_ENV = 'development'

mise unset NODE_ENV
```

Additionally, the [mise env [--json] [--dotenv]](/cli/env.html) command can be used to export the environment variables in various formats (including `PATH` and environment variables set by tools or plugins).

## Using environment variables

Environment variables are available when using [`mise x|exec`](/cli/exec.html), or with [`mise r|run`](/cli/run.html) (i.e. with [tasks](/tasks/)):

```shell
mise set MY_VAR=123
mise exec -- echo $MY_VAR
# 123
```

You can of course combine them with [tools](/dev-tools/):

```sh
mise use node@22
mise set MY_VAR=123
cat mise.toml
# [tools]
# node = '22'
# [env]
# MY_VAR = '123'
mise exec -- node --eval 'console.log(process.env.MY_VAR)'
# 123
```

If [mise is activated](/getting-started.html#activate-mise), it will automatically set environment variables in the current shell session when you `cd` into a directory.

```shell
cd /path/to/project
mise set NODE_ENV=production
cat mise.toml
# [env]
# NODE_ENV = 'production'

echo $NODE_ENV
# production
```

If you are using [`shims`](/dev-tools/shims.html), the environment variables will be available when using the shim:

```shell
mise set NODE_ENV=production
mise use node@22
# using the absolute path for the example
~/.local/share/mise/shims/node --eval 'console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV)'
```

Finally, you can also use [`mise en`](/cli/en.html) to start a new shell session with the environment variables set.

```shell
mise set FOO=bar
mise en
> echo $FOO
# bar
```

## Lazy eval

Environment variables typically are resolved before toolsâ€”that way you can configure tool installation
with environment variables. However, sometimes you want to access environment variables produced by
tools. To do that, turn the value into a map with `tools = true`:

```toml
[env]
MY_VAR = { value = "tools path: {{env.PATH}}", tools = true }
_.path = { path = ["{{env.GEM_HOME}}/bin"], tools = true } # directives may also set tools = true
```

## Redactions

Variables can be redacted from the output by setting `redact = true`:

```toml
[env]
SECRET = { value = "my_secret", redact = true }
_.file = { path = [".env.json"], redact = true }
```

## `env._` directives

`env._.*` define special behavior for setting environment variables. (e.g.: reading env vars
from a file). Since nested environment variables do not make sense,
we make use of this fact by creating a key named "\_" which is a
TOML table for the configuration of these directives.

### `env._.file`

In `mise.toml`: `env._.file` can be used to specify a [dotenv](https://dotenv.org) file to load.
It can be a string or array and uses relative or absolute paths:

```toml
[env]
_.file = '.env'
```

::: info
This uses [dotenvy](https://crates.io/crates/dotenvy) under the hood. If you have problems with
the way `env._.file` works, you will likely need to post an issue there,
not to mise since there is not much mise can do about the way that crate works.
:::

Or set [`MISE_ENV_FILE=.env`](/configuration#mise-env-file) to automatically load dotenv files in any
directory.

You can also use json or yaml files:

```toml
[env]
_.file = '.env.json'
```

See [secrets](/environments/secrets) for ways to read encrypted files with `env._.file`.

### `env._.path`

`PATH` is treated specially. It needs to be defined as a string/array in `mise.path`:

```toml
[env]
_.path = [
    # adds an absolute path
    "~/.local/share/bin",
    # adds paths relative to directory in which this file was found (see below for details), not PWD
    "{{config_root}}/node_modules/.bin",
    # adds paths relative to the exact file that this is found in (not PWD)
    "tools/bin",
]
```

Adding a relative path like `tools/bin` or `./tools/bin` is similar to adding a path rooted at <span v-pre>`{{config_root}}`</span>, but behaves differently if your config file is nested in a subdirectory like `/path/to/project/.config/mise/config.toml`. Including `tools/bin` will add the path `/path/to/project/.config/mise/tools/bin`, whereas including <span v-pre>`{{config_root}}/tools/bin`</span> will add the path `/path/to/project/tools/bin`.

### `env._.source`

Source an external bash script and pull exported environment variables out of it:

```toml
[env]
_.source = "./script.sh"
```

::: info
This **must** be a script that runs in bash as if it were executed like this:

```sh
source ./script.sh
```

The shebang will be **ignored**. See [#1448](https://github.com/jdx/mise/issues/1448)
for a potential alternative that would work with binaries or other script languages.
:::

## Plugin-provided `env._` Directives

Plugins can provide their own `env._` directives. See [mise-env-sample](https://github.com/jdx/mise-env-sample) for an example of one.

## Multiple `env._` Directives

It may be necessary to use multiple `env._` directives, however TOML fails with this syntax
because it has 2 identical keys in a table:

```toml
[env]
_.source = "./script_1.sh"
_.source = "./script_2.sh" # invalid // [!code error]
```

For this use-case, you can optionally make `[env]` an array-of-tables instead by using `[[env]]` instead:

```toml
[[env]]
_.source = "./script_1.sh"
[[env]]
_.source = "./script_2.sh"
```

It works identically but you can have multiple tables.

## Templates

Environment variable values can be templates, see [Templates](/templates) for details.

```toml
[env]
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "/some/path:{{env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}"
```

## Using env vars in other env vars

You can use the value of an environment variable in later env vars:

```toml
[env]
MY_PROJ_LIB = "{{config_root}}/lib"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "/some/path:{{env.MY_PROJ_LIB}}"
```

Of course the ordering matters when doing this.
