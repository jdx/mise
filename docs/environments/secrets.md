# Secrets <Badge type="warning" text="experimental" />

Because env vars in mise.toml can store sensitive information, mise has built-in support for reading
encrypted secrets from files. Currently, this is done with a [sops](https://getsops.io) implementation
however other secret backends could be added in the future.

Secrets are `.env.(json|yaml|toml)` files with a simple structure, for example:

```json
{
  "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
  "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
}
```

Env vars from this can be imported into a mise config with the following:

```toml
[env]
_.file = ".env.json"
```

mise will automatically use a secret backend like sops if the file is encrypted.

## sops

mise uses the rust [rops](https://github.com/gibbz00/rops) library to interact with [sops](https://getsops.io) files.
If you encrypt a sops file, mise will automatically decrypt it when reading the file. sops files can
be in json, yaml, or toml formatâ€”however if you want to use toml you'll need to use the rops cli instead
of sops. Otherwise, either sops or rops will work fine.

::: info
Currently age is the only sops encryption method supported.
:::

In order to encrypt a file with sops, you'll first need to install it (`mise use -g sops`). You'll
also need to install [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) (`mise use -g age`) to generate a keypair for sops to use
if you have not already done so.

To generate a keypair with age run the following and note the public key that is output to use
in the next command to `sops`:

```sh
$ age-keygen -o ~/.config/mise/age.txt
Public key: <public key>
```

Assuming we have a `.env.json` file like at the top of this doc, we can now encrypt it with sops:

```sh
sops encrypt -i --age "<public key>" .env.json
```

::: tip
The `-i` here overwrites the file with an encrypted version. This encrypted version is safe to commit
into your repo as without the private key (`~/.config/mise/age.txt` in this case) the file is useless.

You can later decrypt the file with `sops decrypt -i .env.json` or edit it in EDITOR with `sops edit .env.json`.
However, you'll first need to set SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE to `~/.config/mise/age.txt` to decrypt the file.
:::

Lastly, we need to add the file to our mise config which can be done with `mise set _.file=.env.json`.

Now when you run `mise env` you should see the env vars from the file:

```sh
$ mise env
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

## Working with Encrypted Secrets

Since encrypted files typically contain sensitive information, you should mark them as redacted:

```toml
[env]
_.file = { path = ".env.json", redact = true }
```

This will mark all environment variables from that file as sensitive. You can then use the `mise env` flags to work with these secrets:

```bash
# View only the redacted/sensitive variables
mise env --redacted

# Get just the values (useful for scripts)
mise env --redacted --values
```

:::danger
mise, or other tools, may log secrets in CI systems. You'll want to configure your CI system to redact/mask these values.

### GitHub Actions Integration

When using secrets in GitHub Actions, you must mask them to prevent exposure in logs:

```yaml
- name: Mask secrets
  run: |
    for value in $(mise env --redacted --values); do
      echo "::add-mask::$value"
    done

- name: Use secrets safely
  run: |
    # Now the secrets are masked in the logs
    mise exec -- ./deploy.sh
```

If you're using [mise-action](https://github.com/jdx/mise-action), it automatically handles masking for variables marked with `redact = true`.
