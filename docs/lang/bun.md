# Bun

The following are instructions for using the bun mise core plugin. This is used when there isn't a
git plugin installed named "bun".

The code for this is inside the mise repository at
[`./src/plugins/core/bun.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/plugins/core/bun.rs).

## Usage

The following installs bun and makes it the global default:

```sh
mise use -g bun@0.7     # install bun 0.7.x
mise use -g bun@latest  # install latest bun
```

See available versions with `mise ls-remote bun`.
