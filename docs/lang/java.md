# Java

Like `sdkman`, `mise` can manage multiple versions of Java on the same system.

> The following are instructions for using the java mise core plugin. This is used when there isn't a
> git plugin installed named "java". If you want to use [asdf-java](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java)
> then use `mise plugins install java GIT_URL`.

The code for this is inside the mise repository at
[`./src/plugins/core/java.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/plugins/core/java.rs).

## Usage

The following installs the latest version of openjdk-21.x (if some version of openjdk-21.x is
not already installed) and makes it the global default:

```sh
mise use -g java@openjdk-21
mise use -g java@21         # alternate shorthands for openjdk-only
```

You can also install a jdk from a different vendor:

```sh
mise use -g java@temurin-21
mise use -g java@zulu-21
mise use -g java@corretto-21
```

See available versions with `mise ls-remote java`. com>.

::: warning
Note that shorthand versions (like `21` in the example) use [`OpenJDK`](https://openjdk.org/) as the vendor.
The OpenJDK versions will only be updated for a 6-month period. Updates and security patches will not be available after this short period. This also applies for LTS versions.

For more information on which JDK to choose, see <https://whichjdk.com>.

## macOS JAVA_HOME Integration

Some applications in macOS rely on `/usr/libexec/java_home` to find installed Java runtimes.

To integrate an installed Java runtime with macOS run the following commands for the proper
version (e.g. openjdk-21).

```sh
sudo mkdir /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-21.jdk
sudo ln -s ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java/openjdk-21/Contents /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-21.jdk/Contents
```

> Note: Not all distributions of the Java SDK support this integration (e.g liberica).

## `.java-version` and `.sdkmanrc` files support

The Java core plugin supports the idiomatic version files `.java-version` and `.sdkmanrc`. See [idiomatic version files](/configuration.html#idiomatic-version-files).

For `.sdkmanrc` files, mise will try to map the vendor and version to the appropriate version
string. For example, the version `20.0.2-tem` will be mapped to `temurin-20.0.2`. Due to Azul's Zulu
versioning, the version `11.0.12-zulu` will be mapped to the major version `zulu-11`.

Not all vendors available in [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/jdks) are supported by mise.
The following vendors are NOT supported: `bsg` (Bisheng), `graal` (GraalVM), `nik` (Liberica NIK).

### Using unsupported versions

In case an unsupported version of java is needed, some manual work is required:

1. Download the unsupported version to a directory (e.g `~/.sdkman/candidates/java/21.0.1-open`)
2. symlink the new version:

```sh
ln -s ~/.sdkman/candidates/java/21.0.1-open ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java/21.0.1-open
```

3. If on Mac:

```sh
mkdir ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java/21.0.1-open/Contents
mkdir ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java/21.0.1-open/Contents/MacOS

ln -s ~/.sdkman/candidates/java/21.0.1-open ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java/21.0.1-open/Contents/Home
cp ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java/21.0.1-open/lib/libjli.dylib ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java/21.0.1-open/Contents/MacOS/libjli.dylib
```

4. Don't forget to make sure the cache is blocked and valid, by making sure an **empty** directory **exists** for your version in the [mise cache](https://mise.jdx.dev/directories.html#cache-mise):
   e.g.

```sh
$ ls -R $MISE_CACHE_DIR/java
21.0.1-open

mise/java/21.0.1-open:
```

## Tool Options

The following [tool-options](/dev-tools/#tool-options) are available for the `java` backend.
These options go in the `[tools]` section in `mise.toml`.

### `release_type`

The `release_type` option allows you to specify the type of release to install. The following values
are supported:

- `ga` (default): General Availability release
- `ea`: Early Access release

```toml
[tools]
"java" = { version = "openjdk-21", release_type = "ea" }
```

## Gradle toolchains detection

Gradle can automatically detect toolchains installed by some tools (see [toolchain | auto-detection](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:auto_detection)).

At the moment, `Gradle` does not support auto-detecting Java installations by `mise` (see [gradle/issues/29508](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/29508) and [gradle/issues/29355](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/29355)). A workaround is to leverage the fact that `mise` install layout is [similar to the one used by `asdf`](/ide-integration.html#sdk-selection-using-asdf-layout).

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.asdf/installs/ && ln -s ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java ~/.asdf/installs/
```

Otherwise, you can always use the [foojay-resolver-convention](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver-convention) plugin to let Gradle automatically install JDKs required by your project.
