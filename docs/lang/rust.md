# Rust <Badge type="warning" text="experimental" />

Rust/cargo can be installed which uses rustup under the hood. mise will install rustup if it is not
already installed and add the requested targets. By default, mise uses the default location of rustup/cargo
(`~/.rustup` and `~/.cargo`), but you can change this by setting the `MISE_RUSTUP_HOME` and `MISE_CARGO_HOME`
environment variables if you'd like to isolate mise's rustup/cargo from your other rustup/cargo installations.

Unlike most tools, these won't exist inside of `~/.local/share/mise/installs` because they are managed by rustup.
All mise does is set the `RUST_TOOLCHAIN` environment variable to the requested version and rustup will
automatically install it if it doesn't exist.

## Usage

Use the latest stable version of rust:

```sh
mise use -g rust
cargo build
```

Use the latest beta version of rust:

```sh
mise use -g rust@beta
cargo build
```

Use a specific version of rust:

```sh
mise use -g rust@1.82
cargo build
```

## Tool Options

The following [tool-options](/dev-tools/#tool-options) are available for the `rust` backendâ€”these
go in `[tools]` in `mise.toml`.

### `profile`

The `profile` option allows you to specify the type of release to install. The following values
are supported:

- `minimal`: Includes as few components as possible to get a working compiler (rustc, rust-std, and cargo)
- `default` (default): Includes all of components in the minimal profile, and adds rust-docs, rustfmt, and clippy
- `complete`: Includes all the components available through rustup. This should never be used, as it includes every component ever included in the metadata and thus will almost always fail.

```toml
[tools]
"rust" = { version = "1.83.0", profile = "minimal" }
```
