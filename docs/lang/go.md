# Go

The following are instructions for using the go mise core plugin. This is used when there isn't a
git plugin installed named "go".

If you want to use [asdf-golang](https://github.com/kennyp/asdf-golang)
then use `mise plugins install go GIT_URL`.

The code for this is inside the mise repository at
[`./src/plugins/core/go.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/plugins/core/go.rs).

## Usage

The following installs the latest version of go-1.21.x (if some version of 1.21.x is not already
installed) and makes it the global default:

```sh
mise use -g go@1.21
```

Minor go versions 1.20 and below require specifying `prefix` before the version number because the
first version of each series was released without a `.0` suffix, making 1.20 an exact version match:

```sh
mise use -g go@prefix:1.20
```

## Configuration

Set these with `mise settings set [VARIABLE] [VALUE]` or by setting the environment variable.

### `go_default_packages_file`

* Type: `string`
* Env: `MISE_GO_DEFAULT_PACKAGES_FILE`
* Default: `~/.default-go-packages`

Packages list to install with `go install` after installing a Go version.

### `go_download_mirror`

* Type: `string`
* Env: `MISE_GO_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR`
* Default: `https://dl.google.com/go`

URL to download go sdk tarballs from.

### `go_repo`

* Type: `string`
* Env: `MISE_GO_REPO`
* Default: `https://github.com/golang/go`

Used to get latest go version from GitHub releases.

### `go_set_gobin`

* Type: `bool | null`
* Env: `MISE_GO_SET_GOBIN`
* Default: `null`

Sets `GOBIN` to `~/.local/share/mise/go/installs/[VERSION]/bin`. This causes CLIs installed via
`go install` to have shims created for it which will have env vars from mise such as GOROOT set.

If not using shims or not using `go install` with tools that require GOROOT, it can probably be
safely disabled. See the [go backend](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/) for the preferred
method to install Go CLIs.

### `go_set_gopath` <Badge type="warning" text="deprecated" />

* Type: `bool`
* Env: `MISE_GO_SET_GOPATH`
* Default: `false`

Sets `GOPATH` to `~/.local/share/mise/go/installs/[VERSION]/packages`. This retains behavior from
asdf and older mise/rtx versions. There is no known reason for this to be enabled but it is available
(for now) just in case anyone relies on it.

### `go_skip_checksum`

* Type: `bool`
* Env: `MISE_GO_SKIP_CHECKSUM`
* Default: `false`

Skips checksum verification of downloaded go tarballs.

## Default packages

mise can automatically install a default set of packages right after installing a new go version.
To enable this feature, provide a `$HOME/.default-go-packages` file that lists one packages per
line, for example:

```text
github.com/Dreamacro/clash # allows comments
github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit
```

## `.go-version` file support

mise uses a `.tool-versions` or `.mise.toml` file for auto-switching between software versions.
However it can also read go-specific version files named `.go-version`.
