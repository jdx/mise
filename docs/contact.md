`mise` is mostly built and maintained by me, [Jeff Dickey](https://jdx.dev). The goal is
to make local development of software easy and consistent across languages. I
have spent many years building dev tools and thinking about the problems that `mise`
addresses.

I try to use the first-person in these docs since the reality is it's generally me
writing them and I think it makes it more interesting having a bit of my personality
in the text.

This project is simply a labor of love. I am making it because I want to make
your life as a developer easier. I hope you find it useful. Feedback is a massive
driver for me. If you have anything positive or negative to say-even if it's just
to say hi-please reach out to me either on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jdxcode),
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jdx), [Discord](https://discord.gg/UBa7pJUN7Z),
or `jdx at this domain`.
