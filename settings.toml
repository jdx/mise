Pushes tools' bin-paths to the front of PATH instead of allowing modifications of PATH after activation to take precedence. For example, if you have the following in your `mise.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
node = '20'
python = '3.12'
```

But you also have this in your `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"
PATH="/some/other/python:$PATH"
```

What will happen is `/some/other/python` will be used instead of the python installed by mise. This
means
you typically want to put `mise activate` at the end of your shell config so nothing overrides it.

If you want to always use the mise versions of tools despite what is in your shell config, set this
to `true`.
In that case, using this example again, `/some/other/python` will be after mise's python in PATH.
