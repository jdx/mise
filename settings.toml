description = "Pushes tools' bin-paths to the front of PATH instead of allowing modifications of PATH after activation to take precedence."
docs = """
Pushes tools' bin-paths to the front of PATH instead of allowing modifications of PATH after activation to take precedence. For example, if you have the following in your `mise.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
node = '20'
python = '3.12'
```

But you also have this in your `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"
PATH="/some/other/python:$PATH"
```

What will happen is `/some/other/python` will be used instead of the python installed by mise. This
means
you typically want to put `mise activate` at the end of your shell config so nothing overrides it.

If you want to always use the mise versions of tools despite what is in your shell config, set this
to `true`.
In that case, using this example again, `/some/other/python` will be after mise's python in PATH.

Enables experimental features. I generally will publish new features under

as "experimental" its behavior may change or even disappear in any release.

The idea is experimental features can be iterated on this way so we can get
the behavior right, but once that label goes away you shouldn't expect things
to change without a proper deprecation—and even then it's unlikely.

Also, I very often will use experimental as a beta flag as well. New
functionality that I want to test with a smaller subset of users I will often
push out under experimental mode even if it's not related to an experimental
feature.

If you'd like to help me out, consider enabling it even if you don't have
a particular feature you'd like to try. Also, if something isn't working
right, try disabling it if you can.
