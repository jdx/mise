# Security Policy

We do not offer any security policy for the contents of this repository.

## No Security Provided

This repository was created as a usability convenience, it is not required to
use asdf.

This repository is a collection of asdf plugins found online, it is a collaborative
effort by the community. Repositories linked from here are:

- not covered by any security policy from the asdf team
- not scanned automatically for dangerous or malicious operation

## What the asdf Team Recommend

The expectation is that users will vet the code of each plugin before use, as is
expected of other OSS plugin and package ecosystems.

The asdf core team discourage the use of this shortname repository. Read the code
in the plugins you use. Install the plugins you trust via the direct URL method:

```bash
asdf plugin add <name> <git_url>
```
