_Polyglot runtime manager (asdf rust clone)_

## 30 Second Demo

The following shows using rtx to install node, python, and jq into a project using a `.tool-versions` file.

[![demo](./docs/demo.gif)](./docs/demo.gif)

## Features

- **asdf-compatible** - rtx is compatible with asdf plugins and `.tool-versions` files. It can be used as a drop-in replacement.
- **Polyglot** - compatible with any language, so no more figuring out how nvm, nodenv, pyenv, etc work individually—just use 1 tool.
- **Fast** - rtx is written in Rust and is very fast. 20x-200x faster than asdf.
- **No shims** - shims (used by asdf) cause problems, they break `which node`, and add overhead. We don't use them.
- **Better UX** - asdf is full of strange UX decisions (like `asdf plugin add` but also `asdf install`). We've taken care to make rtx easy to use.
- **Fuzzy matching and aliases** - no need to specify exact version numbers like with asdf.
- **One command install** - No need to manually install each plugin, just run `rtx install --all` and it will install all the plugins you need.

## Quickstart

Install rtx (other methods [here](#installation)):

```sh-session
$ curl https://rtx.pub/rtx-latest-macos-arm64 > ~/bin/rtx
$ chmod +x ~/bin/rtx
$ rtx --version
rtx 1.9.0
```

Hook rtx into to your shell. This will automatically add `~/bin` to `PATH` if it isn't already.
(choose one, and open a new shell session for the changes to take effect):

```sh-session
$ echo 'eval "$(~/bin/rtx activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'eval "$(~/bin/rtx activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
$ echo '~/bin/rtx activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

> **Warning**
>
> If you use direnv, you will want to activate direnv _before_ rtx. There is also
> an alternative way to use rtx inside of direnv, see [here](#direnv).

Install a runtime and set it as the default:

```sh-session
$ rtx install nodejs@18
$ rtx global nodejs@18
$ node -v
v18.10.9
```

> **Note**
>
> `rtx install` is optional, `rtx global` will prompt to install the runtime if it's not
> already installed. This is configurable in [`~/.config/rtx/config.toml`](#configuration).


## About

rtx is a tool for managing programming language and tool versions. For example, use this to install
a particular version of node.js and ruby for a project. Using `rtx activate`, you can have your
shell automatically switch to the correct node and ruby versions when you `cd` into the project's
directory. Other projects on your machine can use a different set of versions.

rtx is inspired by [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) and uses asdf's vast [plugin ecosystem](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins)
under the hood. However, it is _much_ faster than asdf and has a more friendly user experience.
For more on how rtx compares to asdf, [see below](#comparison-to-asdf). The goal of this project
was to create a better front-end to asdf.

It uses the same `.tool-versions` file that asdf uses. It's also compatible with idiomatic version
files like `.node-version` and `.ruby-version`. See [Legacy Version Files](#legacy-version-files) below.

Come chat about rtx on [discord](https://discord.gg/mABnUDvP57).

### How it works

rtx installs as a shell extension (e.g. `rtx activate zsh`) that sets the `PATH`
environment variable to point your shell to the correct runtime binaries. When you `cd` into a
directory containing a `.tool-versions` file, rtx will automatically activate the correct versions.

Every time your prompt starts it will call `rtx hook-env` to fetch new environment variables. This
should be very fast and it exits early if the the directory wasn't changed or the `.tool-versions`
files haven't been updated. On my machine this takes 4ms in the fast case, 14ms in the slow case. See [Performance](#performance) for more on this topic.

Unlike asdf which uses shim files to dynamically locate runtimes when they're called, rtx modifies
`PATH` ahead of time so the runtimes are called directly. This is not only faster since it avoids
any overhead, but it also makes it so commands like `which node` work as expected. This also
means there isn't any need to run `asdf reshim` after installing new runtime binaries.

### Common example commands

    rtx install nodejs@20.0.0       Install a specific version number
    rtx install nodejs@20.0         Install a fuzzy version number
    rtx local nodejs@20             Use node-20.x in current project
    rtx global nodejs@20            Use node-20.x as default

    rtx install nodejs              Install the version specified in .tool-versions
    rtx local nodejs@latest         Use latest node in current directory
    rtx global nodejs@system        Use system node as default

    rtx x nodejs@20 -- node app.js  Run `node app.js` with the PATH pointing to node-20.x

## Installation

> **Warning**
>
> Regardless of the installation method, when uninstalling rtx,
> remove `RTX_DATA_DIR` folder (usually `~/.local/share/rtx`) to fully clean up.

### Standalone

Note that it isn't necessary for `rtx` to be on `PATH`. If you run the activate script in your rc
file, rtx will automatically add itself to `PATH`.

```sh-session
$ curl https://rtx.pub/install.sh | sh
```

> **Note**
>
> There isn't currently an autoupdater in rtx. So if you use this method you'll need to remember
> to fetch a new version manually for bug/feature fixes. I'm not sure if I'll ever add an autoupdater
> because it might be disruptive to autoupdate to a major version that has breaking changes.

or if you're allergic to `| sh`:

```sh-session
$ curl https://rtx.pub/rtx-latest-macos-arm64 > /usr/local/bin/rtx
```

It doesn't matter where you put it. So use `~/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/share/rtx/bin/rtx`
or whatever.

Supported architectures:

- `x64`
- `arm64`

Supported platforms:

- `macos`
- `linux`

If you need something else, compile it with [cargo](#cargo).

### Homebrew

There are 2 ways to install rtx with Homebrew. The recommended method is to use
the custom tap which will always contain the latest release.

```sh-session
$ brew install jdxcode/tap/rtx
```

Alternatively, you can use the built-in tap (homebrew-core), which will be updated
once Homebrew maintainers merge the PR for a new release:

```sh-session
$ brew install rtx
```

### Cargo

Build from source with Cargo.

```sh-session
$ cargo install rtx-cli
```

Do it faster with [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

```sh-session
$ cargo install cargo-binstall
$ cargo binstall rtx-cli
```

### npm

rtx is available on npm as precompiled binaries. This isn't a node.js package, just distributed
via npm. It can be useful for JS projects that want to setup rtx via `package.json` or `npx`.

```sh-session
$ npm install -g @jdxcode/rtx
```

Or use npx if you just want to test it out for a single command without fully installing:

```sh-session
$ npx @jdxcode/rtx exec python@3.11 -- python some_script.py
```

### GitHub Releases

Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx/releases).

```sh-session
$ curl https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx/releases/download/v1.9.0/rtx-v1.9.0-linux-x64 | tar -xJv
$ mv rtx/bin/rtx /usr/local/bin
```

### apt

For installation on Ubuntu/Debian:

```sh-session
wget -qO - https://rtx.pub/gpg-key.pub | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/rtx-archive-keyring.gpg 1> /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/rtx-archive-keyring.gpg arch=amd64] https://rtx.pub/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rtx.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y rtx
```

> **Warning**
>
> If you're on arm64 you'll need to run the following:
> ```
> echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/rtx-archive-keyring.gpg arch=arm64] https://rtx.pub/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rtx.list
> ```

### dnf

For Fedora, CentOS, Amazon Linux, RHEL and other dnf-based distributions:

```sh-session
dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rtx.pub/rpm/rtx.repo
dnf install -y rtx
```

### yum

```sh-session
yum install -y yum-utils
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rtx.pub/rpm/rtx.repo
yum install -y rtx
```

### ~~apk~~ (coming soon)

For Alpine Linux:

```sh-session
apk add rtx --repository=http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing/
```

### aur

For Arch Linux:

```sh-session
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/rtx.git
cd rtx
makepkg -si
```

## Other Shells

### Bash

```sh-session
$ echo 'eval "$(rtx activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Fish

```sh-session
$ echo 'rtx activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

### Xonsh

Since `.xsh` files are [not compiled](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3953) you may shave a bit off startup time by using a pure Python import: add the code below to, for example, `~/.config/xonsh/rtx.py` config file and `import rtx` it in `~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh`:
```xsh
from pathlib        	import Path
from xonsh.built_ins	import XSH

ctx = XSH.ctx
rtx_init = subprocess.run([Path('~/bin/rtx').expanduser(),'activate','xonsh'],capture_output=True,encoding="UTF-8").stdout
XSH.builtins.execx(rtx_init,'exec',ctx,filename='rtx')
```

Or continue to use `rc.xsh`/`.xonshrc`:
```xsh
echo 'execx($(~/bin/rtx activate xonsh))' >> ~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh # or ~/.xonshrc
```

Given that `rtx` replaces both shell env `$PATH` and OS environ `PATH`, watch out that your configs don't have these two set differently (might throw `os.environ['PATH'] = xonsh.built_ins.XSH.env.get_detyped('PATH')` at the end of a config to make sure they match)

### Something else?

Adding a new shell is not hard at all since very little shell code is
in this project.
[See here](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx/tree/main/src/shell) for how
the others are implemented. If your shell isn't currently supported
I'd be happy to help you get yours integrated.

## Configuration

### `.tool-versions`

The `.tool-versions` file is used to specify the runtime versions for a project. An example of this
is:

```
nodejs      20.0.0  # comments are allowed
ruby        3       # can be fuzzy version
shellcheck  latest  # also supports "latest"
jq          1.6
```

Create `.tool-versions` files manually, or use [`rtx local`](#rtx-local) to create them automatically.
See [the asdf docs](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/configuration.html#tool-versions) for more info on this file format.

### Legacy version files

RTX supports "legacy version files" just like asdf.

It's behind a config setting "legacy_version_file", but it's enabled by default (asdf defaults to disabled).
You can disable these with `rtx settings set legacy_version_file false`. There is a performance cost
to having these when they're parsed as it's performed by the plugin in `bin/parse-version-file`. However
these are [cached](#cache-behavior) so it's not a huge deal. You may not even notice.

These are ideal for setting the runtime version of a project without forcing other developers to
use a specific tool like rtx/asdf.

They support aliases, which means you can (finally) have an `.nvmrc` file with `lts/hydrogen`
and it will work in rtx _and_ nvm. This wasn't possible with asdf.

Here are some of the supported legacy version files:

| Plugin    | "Legacy" (Idiomatic) Files                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| crystal   | `.crystal-version`                                 |
| elixir    | `.exenv-version`                                   |
| golang    | `.go-version`, `go.mod`                            |
| java      | `.java-version`                                    |
| nodejs    | `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`                          |
| python    | `.python-version`                                  |
| ruby      | `.ruby-version`, `Gemfile`                         |
| terraform | `.terraform-version`, `.packer-version`, `main.tf` |
| yarn      | `.yvmrc`                                           |

> **Note**
>
> asdf calls these "legacy version files" so we do too. I think this is a bad name since it implies
> that they shouldn't be used—which is definitely not the case IMO. I prefer the term "idiomatic"
> version files since they're version files not specific to asdf/rtx and can be used by other tools.
> (`.nvmrc` being a notable exception, which is tied to a specific tool.)

### Global config: `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`

rtx can be configured in `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`. The following options are available (defaults shown):

```toml
# whether to prompt to install plugins and runtimes if they're not already installed
missing_runtime_behavior = 'prompt' # other options: 'ignore', 'warn', 'prompt', 'autoinstall'

# plugins can read the versions files used by other version managers (if enabled by the plugin)
# for example, .nvmrc in the case of nodejs's nvm
legacy_version_file = true         # enabled by default (different than asdf)

# configure `rtx install` to always keep the downloaded archive
always_keep_download = false        # deleted after install by default

# configure how frequently (in minutes) to fetch updated plugin repository changes
# this is updated whenever a new runtime is installed
# (note: this isn't currently implemented but there are plans to add it: https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx/issues/128)
plugin_autoupdate_last_check_duration = 10080 # (one week) set to 0 to disable updates

verbose = false # see explanation under `RTX_VERBOSE`

[alias.nodejs]
my_custom_node = '18'  # makes `rtx install nodejs@my_custom_node` install node-18.x
                       # this can also be specified in a plugin (see below in "Aliases")
```

These settings can also be managed with `rtx settings ls|get|set|unset`.

### Environment variables

rtx can also be configured via environment variables. The following options are available:

#### `RTX_MISSING_RUNTIME_BEHAVIOR`

This is the same as the `missing_runtime_behavior` config option in `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`.

#### `RTX_DATA_DIR`

This is the directory where rtx stores its data. The default is `~/.local/share/rtx`.

```sh-session
$ RTX_MISSING_RUNTIME_BEHAVIOR=ignore rtx install nodejs@20
$ RTX_NODEJS_VERSION=20 rtx exec -- node --version
```

#### `RTX_CONFIG_FILE`

This is the path to the config file. The default is `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`.
(Or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/config.toml` if that is set)

#### `RTX_DEFAULT_TOOL_VERSIONS_FILENAME`

Set to something other than ".tool-versions" to have rtx look for configuration with alternate names.

#### `RTX_${PLUGIN}_VERSION`

Set the version for a runtime. For example, `RTX_NODEJS_VERSION=20` will use nodejs@20.x regardless
of what is set in `.tool-versions`.

#### `RTX_LEGACY_VERSION_FILE`

Plugins can read the versions files used by other version managers (if enabled by the plugin)
for example, .nvmrc in the case of nodejs's nvm.

#### `RTX_LOG_LEVEL=trace|debug|info|warn|error`

Can also use `RTX_DEBUG=1`, `RTX_TRACE=1`, and `RTX_QUIET=1`. These adjust the log
output to the screen.

#### `RTX_LOG_FILE=~/.rtx/rtx.log`

Output logs to a file.

#### `RTX_LOG_FILE_LEVEL=trace|debug|info|warn|error`

Same as `RTX_LOG_LEVEL` but for the log file output level. This is useful if you want
to store the logs but not have them litter your display.

#### `RTX_VERBOSE=1`

This shows the installation output during `rtx install` and `rtx plugin install`.
This should likely be merged so it behaves the same as `RTX_DEBUG=1` and we don't have
2 configuration for the same thing, but for now it is it's own config.

#### `RTX_HIDE_OUTDATED_BUILD=1`

If a release is 12 months old, it will show a warning message every time it launches:

```
rtx has not been updated in over a year. Please update to the latest version.
```

You likely do not want to be using rtx if it is that old. I'm doing this instead of
autoupdating. If, for some reason, you want to stay on some old version, you can hide
this message with `RTX_HIDE_OUTDATED_BUILD=1`.

## Aliases

rtx supports aliasing the versions of runtimes. One use-case for this is to define aliases for LTS
versions of runtimes. For example, you may want to specify `lts/hydrogen` as the version for nodejs@18.x.
So you can use the runtime with `nodejs lts/hydrogen` in `.tool-versions`.

User aliases can be created by adding an `alias.<PLUGIN>` section to `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`:

```toml
[alias.nodejs]
my_custom_18 = '18'
```

Plugins can also provide aliases via a `bin/list-aliases` script. Here is an example showing node.js
versions:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "lts/hydrogen 18"
echo "lts/gallium 16"
echo "lts/fermium 14"
```

> **Note:**
>
> Because this is rtx-specific functionality not currently used by asdf it isn't likely to be in any
> plugin currently, but plugin authors can add this script without impacting asdf users.

## Plugins

rtx uses asdf's plugin ecosystem under the hood. See https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins for a
list.

## FAQs

### I don't want to put a `.tool-versions` file into my project since git shows it as an untracked file.

You can make git ignore these files in 3 different ways:

- Adding `.tool-versions` to project's `.gitignore` file. This has the downside that you need to commit the change to the ignore file.
- Adding `.tool-versions` to project's `.git/info/exclude`. This file is local to your project so there is no need to commit it.
- Adding `.tool-versions` to global gitignore (`core.excludesFile`). This will cause git to ignore `.tool-versions` files in all projects. You can explicitly add one to a project if needed with `git add --force .tool-versions`.

### How do I create my own plugin?

Just follow the [asdf docs](https://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html). Everything should work the same.
If it isn't, please open an issue.

### rtx is failing or not working right

First try setting `RTX_LOG_LEVEL=debug` or `RTX_LOG_LEVEL=trace` and see if that gives you more information.
You can also set `RTX_LOG_FILE=/path/to/logfile` to write the logs to a file.

If something is happening with the activate hook, you can try disabling it and calling `eval "$(rtx hook-env)"` manually.
It can also be helpful to use `rtx env` to see what environment variables it wants to use.

Lastly, there is an `rtx doctor` command. It doesn't have much in it but I hope to add more functionality
to that to help debug issues.

### Windows support?

This is unlikely to ever happen since this leverages the vast ecosystem of asdf plugins which are built on Bash scripts.
At some point it may be worth exploring an alternate plugin format that would be Windows compatible.

## Commands

### `rtx activate`

```
Enables rtx to automatically modify runtimes when changing directory

This should go into your shell's rc file.
Otherwise, it will only take effect in the current session.
(e.g. ~/.bashrc)

Usage: activate [OPTIONS] [SHELL_TYPE]

Arguments:
  [SHELL_TYPE]
          Shell type to generate the script for
          
          [possible values: bash, fish, xonsh, zsh]

Options:
  -q, --quiet
          Hide the "rtx: <PLUGIN>@<VERSION>" message when changing directories

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
    $ eval "$(rtx activate bash)"
    $ eval "$(rtx activate zsh)"
    $ rtx activate fish | source
    $ execx($(rtx activate xonsh))

```
### `rtx alias ls`

```
List aliases
Shows the aliases that can be specified.
These can come from user config or from plugins in `bin/list-aliases`.

For user config, aliases are defined like the following in `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`:

  [alias.nodejs]
  lts = "18.0.0"

Usage: ls [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --plugin <PLUGIN>
          Show aliases for <PLUGIN>

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  $ rtx aliases
  nodejs    lts/hydrogen   18.0.0

```
### `rtx complete`

```
generate shell completions

Usage: complete --shell <SHELL>

Options:
  -s, --shell <SHELL>
          shell type
          
          [possible values: bash, elvish, fish, powershell, zsh]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  $ rtx complete

```
### `rtx current`

```
Shows currently active, and installed runtime versions

This is similar to `rtx list --current`, but this
only shows the runtime and/or version so it's
designed to fit into scripts more easily.

Usage: current [PLUGIN]

Arguments:
  [PLUGIN]
          plugin to show versions of
          
          e.g.: ruby, nodejs

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  # outputs `.tool-versions` compatible format
  $ rtx current
  python 3.11.0 3.10.0
  shfmt 3.6.0
  shellcheck 0.9.0
  nodejs 18.13.0

  $ rtx current nodejs
  18.13.0

  # can output multiple versions
  $ rtx current python
  3.11.0 3.10.0

```
### `rtx deactivate`

```
disable rtx for current shell session

This can be used to temporarily disable rtx in a shell session.

Usage: deactivate [SHELL_TYPE]

Arguments:
  [SHELL_TYPE]
          shell type to generate the script for
          
          [possible values: bash, fish, xonsh, zsh]

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  $ eval "$(rtx deactivate bash)"
  $ eval "$(rtx deactivate zsh)"
  $ rtx deactivate fish | source
  $ execx($(rtx deactivate xonsh))

```
### `rtx direnv activate`

```
Output direnv function to use rtx inside direnv

See https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx#direnv for more information

Because this generates the legacy files based on currently installed plugins,
you should run this command after installing new plugins. Otherwise
direnv may not know to update environment variables when legacy file versions change.

Usage: activate

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  $ rtx direnv activate > ~/.config/direnv/lib/use_rtx.sh
  $ echo 'use rtx' > .envrc
  $ direnv allow

```
### `rtx doctor`

```
Check rtx installation for possible problems.

Usage: doctor

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  $ rtx doctor
  [WARN] plugin nodejs is not installed

```
### `rtx env`

```
exports env vars to activate rtx in a single shell session

It's not necessary to use this if you have `rtx activate` in your shell rc file.
Use this if you don't want to permanently install rtx.
This can be used similarly to `asdf shell`.
Unfortunately, it requires `eval` to work since it's not written in Bash though.
It's also useful just to see what environment variables rtx sets.

Usage: env [OPTIONS] [RUNTIME]...

Arguments:
  [RUNTIME]...
          runtime version to use

Options:
  -s, --shell <SHELL>
          Shell type to generate environment variables for
          
          [possible values: bash, fish, xonsh, zsh]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  $ eval "$(rtx env -s bash)"
  $ eval "$(rtx env -s zsh)"
  $ rtx env -s fish | source
  $ execx($(rtx env -s xonsh))

```
### `rtx exec`

```
execute a command with runtime(s) set

use this to avoid modifying the shell session or running ad-hoc commands with the rtx runtimes
set.

Runtimes will be loaded from .tool-versions, though they can be overridden with <RUNTIME> args
Note that only the plugin specified will be overridden, so if a `.tool-versions` file
includes "nodejs 20" but you run `rtx exec python@3.11`; it will still load nodejs@20.

The "--" separates runtimes from the commands to pass along to the subprocess.

Usage: exec [OPTIONS] [RUNTIME]... [-- <COMMAND>...]

Arguments:
  [RUNTIME]...
          runtime(s) to start

### `rtx global`

```
sets global .tool-versions to include a specified runtime

then displays the contents of ~/.tool-versions

          .tool-versions will be displayed

Options:
      --fuzzy
          save fuzzy match to .tool-versions e.g.: `rtx global --fuzzy nodejs@20` will save `nodejs 20` to .tool-versions, by default, it would save the exact version, e.g.: `nodejs 20.0.0`

  # show the current version of nodejs in ~/.tool-versions
  $ rtx global nodejs
  20.0.0

```
### `rtx install`

```
install a runtime

this will install a runtime to `~/.local/share/rtx/installs/<PLUGIN>/<VERSION>`
it won't be used simply by being installed, however.
For that, you must set up a `.tool-version` file manually or with `rtx local/global`.
Or you can call a runtime explicitly with `rtx exec <PLUGIN>@<VERSION> -- <COMMAND>`.

Usage: install [OPTIONS] [RUNTIME]...

Arguments:
  [RUNTIME]...
          runtime(s) to install
          
          e.g.: nodejs@20

Options:
  -p, --plugin <PLUGIN>
          only install runtime(s) for <PLUGIN>

  -f, --force
          force reinstall even if already installed

Examples:
  $ rtx install nodejs@18.0.0  # install specific nodejs version
  $ rtx install nodejs@18      # install fuzzy nodejs version
  $ rtx install nodejs         # install version specified in .tool-versions
  $ rtx install                # installs all runtimes specified in .tool-versions for installed plugins
  $ rtx install --all          # installs all runtimes and all plugins

```
### `rtx latest`

```
get the latest runtime version of a plugin's runtimes

          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  $ rtx latest nodejs@18  # get the latest version of nodejs 18
  18.0.0

  $ rtx latest nodejs     # get the latest stable version of nodejs
  20.0.0

```
### `rtx local`

```

Arguments:
  [RUNTIME]...
          runtimes to add to .tool-versions
          
          e.g.: nodejs@20
          if this is a single runtime with no version,
          the current value of .tool-versions will be displayed

Options:
  -p, --parent
          recurse up to find a .tool-versions file rather than using the current directory only
          by default this command will only set the runtime in the current directory ("$PWD/.tool-versions")

      --fuzzy
          save fuzzy match to .tool-versions
          e.g.: `rtx local --fuzzy nodejs@20` will save `nodejs 20` to .tool-versions
          without --fuzzy, it would save the exact version, e.g.: `nodejs 20.0.0`

      --remove <PLUGIN>
          remove the plugin(s) from .tool-versions

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  # set the current version of nodejs to 20.x for the current directory
  # will use a precise version (e.g.: 20.0.0) in .tool-versions file
  $ rtx local nodejs@20

  # set nodejs to 20.x for the current project (recurses up to find .tool-versions)
  $ rtx local -p nodejs@20

  # set the current version of nodejs to 20.x for the current directory
  # will use a fuzzy version (e.g.: 20) in .tool-versions file
  $ rtx local --fuzzy nodejs@20

          Reinstall even if plugin exists

  -a, --all
          Install all missing plugins

  -v, --verbose...
          Show installation output

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:
  $ rtx install nodejs  # install the nodejs plugin using the shorthand repo:

## Comparison to asdf

rtx is mostly a clone of asdf, but there are notable areas where improvements have been made.

### Performance

asdf made (what I consider) a poor design decision to use shims that go between a call to a runtime
and the runtime itself. e.g.: when you call `node` it will call an asdf shim file `~/.asdf/shims/node`,
which then calls `asdf exec`, which then calls the correct version of node.

These shims have terrible performance, adding ~120ms to every runtime call. rtx does not use shims and instead
updates `PATH` so that it doesn't have any overhead when simply calling binaries. These shims are the main reason that I wrote this.

I don't think it's possible for asdf to fix these issues. The author of asdf did a great writeup
of [performance problems](https://stratus3d.com/blog/2022/08/11/asdf-performance/). asdf is written
in bash which certainly makes it challenging to be performant, however I think the real problem is the
shim design. I don't think it's possible to fix that without a complete rewrite.

rtx does call an internal command `rtx hook-env` every time the directory has changed, but because
it's written in Rust, this is very quick—taking ~10ms on my machine. 4ms if there are no changes, 14ms if it's
a full reload.

tl;dr: asdf adds overhead (~120ms) when calling a runtime, rtx adds a small amount of overhead (~10ms)
when the prompt loads.

### Environment variables

asdf only helps manage runtime executables. However, some tools are managed via environment variables
(notably Java which switches via `JAVA_HOME`). This isn't supported very well in asdf and requires
a separate shell extension just to manage.

However asdf _plugins_ have a `bin/exec-env` script that is used for exporting environment variables
like [`JAVA_HOME`](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java/blob/master/bin/exec-env). rtx simply exports
the environment variables from the `bin/exec-env` script in the plugin but places them in the shell
for _all_ commands. In asdf it only exports those commands when the shim is called. This means if you
call `java` it will set `JAVA_HOME`, but not if you call some Java tool like `mvn`.

This means we're just using the existing plugin script but because rtx doesn't use shims it can be
used for more things. It would be trivial to make a plugin that exports arbitrary environment
variables like [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) or [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv).

### UX

Some commands are the same in asdf but others have been changed. Everything that's possible
in asdf should be possible in rtx but may use slightly different syntax. rtx has more forgiving commands,
such as using fuzzy-matching, e.g.: `rtx install nodejs@18`. While in asdf you _can_ run
`asdf install nodejs latest:18`, you can't use `latest:18` in a `.tool-versions` file or many other places.
In `rtx` you can use fuzzy-matching everywhere.

asdf requires several steps to install a new runtime if the plugin isn't installed, e.g.:

```sh-session
$ asdf plugin add nodejs
$ asdf install nodejs latest:18
$ asdf local nodejs latest:18
```

In `rtx` this can all be done in a single step to set the local runtime version. If the plugin
and/or runtime needs to be installed it will prompt:

```sh-session
$ asdf local nodejs@18
rtx: Would you like to install nodejs@18.13.0? [Y/n] Y
Trying to update node-build... ok
Downloading node-v18.13.0-darwin-arm64.tar.gz...
-> https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.13.0/node-v18.13.0-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
Installing node-v18.13.0-darwin-arm64...
Installed node-v18.13.0-darwin-arm64 to /Users/jdx/.local/share/rtx/installs/nodejs/18.13.0
$ node -v
v18.13.0
```

I've found asdf to be particularly rigid and difficult to learn. It also made strange decisions like
having `asdf list all` but `asdf latest --all` (why is one a flag and one a positional argument?).
`rtx` makes heavy use of aliases so you don't need to remember if it's `rtx plugin add nodejs` or
`rtx plugin install nodejs`. If I can guess what you meant, then I'll try to get rtx to respond
in the right way.

That said, there are a lot of great things about asdf. It's the best multi-runtime manager out there
and I've really been impressed with the plugin system. Most of the design decisions the authors made
were very good. I really just have 2 complaints: the shims and the fact it's written in Bash.

## direnv

[direnv](https://direnv.net) and rtx both manage environment variables based on directory. Because they both analyze
the current environment variables before and after their respective "hook" commands are run, they can conflict with each other.
As a result, there were a [number of issues with direnv](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx/issues/8).
However, we think we've mitigated these. If you find that rtx and direnv are not working well together,
please comment on that ticket ideally with a good description of your directory layout so we can
reproduce the problem.

If there are remaining issues, they're likely to do with the ordering of PATH. This means it would
really only be a problem if you were trying to manage the same runtime with direnv and rtx. For example,
you may use `layout python` in an `.envrc` but also be maintaining a `.tool-versions` file with python
in it as well.

A more typical usage of direnv would be to set some arbitrary environment variables, or add unrelated
binaries to PATH. In these cases, rtx will not interfere with direnv.

As mentioned in the Quick Start, it is important to make sure that `rtx activate` is called after `direnv hook`
in the shell rc file. rtx overrides some of the internal direnv state (`DIRENV_DIFF`) so calling
direnv first gives rtx the opportunity to make those changes to direnv's state.

### rtx inside of direnv (`use rtx` in `.envrc`)

If you do encounter issues with `rtx activate`, or just want to use direnv in an alternate way,
this is a simpler setup that's less likely to cause issues.

To do this, first use `rtx` to build a `use_rtx` function that you can use in `.envrc` files:

```sh-session
$ rtx direnv activate > ~/.config/direnv/lib/use_rtx.sh
# replace ~/.config with XDG_CONFIG_HOME if you've changed it
```

Now in your `.envrc` file add the following:

```sh-session
use rtx
```

direnv will now call rtx to export its environment variables. You'll need to make sure to add `use_rtx`
to all projects that use rtx (or use direnv's `source_up` to load it from a subdirectory). You can also add `use rtx` to `~/.config/direnv/direnvrc`.

Note that in this method direnv typically won't know to refresh `.tool-versions` files
unless they're at the same level as a `.envrc` file. You'll likely always want to have
a `.envrc` file next to your `.tool-versions` for this reason. To make this a little
easier to manage, I encourage _not_ actually using `.tool-versions` at all, and instead
setting environment variables entirely in `.envrc`:

```
export RTX_NODEJS_VERSION=18.0.0
export RTX_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
```

Of course if you use `rtx activate`, then these steps won't have been necessary and you can use rtx
as if direnv was not used.

## Cache Behavior

rtx makes use of caching in many places in order to be efficient. The details about how long to keep
cache for should eventually all be configurable. There may be gaps in the current behavior where
things are hardcoded but I'm happy to add more settings to cover whatever config is needed.

Below I explain the behavior it uses around caching. If you're seeing behavior where things don't appear
to be updating, this is a good place to start.

### Plugin Cache

Each plugin has a cache that's stored in `~/.local/share/rtx/plugins/<PLUGIN>/.rtxcache.msgpack.gz`. It stores
the list of versions available for that plugin (`rtx ls-remote <PLUGIN>`) and the legacy filenames (see below).

It is updated daily by default or anytime that `rtx ls-remote` is called explicitly. The file is
gzipped messagepack, if you want to view it you can run the following (requires [msgpack-cli](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-cli)).

```sh-session
cat ~/.local/share/rtx/plugins/nodejs/.rtxcache.msgpack.gz | gunzip | msgpack-cli decode
```

### Runtime Cache

Each runtime (language version, e.g.: `nodejs@20.0.0`), has a file called "runtimeconf" that's stored
inside the install directory, e.g.: `~/.asdf/installs/nodejs/20.0.0/.rtxconf.msgpack`. This stores the
information about the runtime that should not change after installation. Currently this is just the
bin paths the plugin defines in `bin/list-bin-paths`. By default this is just `/bin`. It's the list
of paths that rtx will add to `PATH` when the runtime is activated.

I have not seen a plugins which has _dynamic_ bin paths but let me know if you find one. If that is
the case, we may need to make this cached instead of static.

"Runtimeconf" is stored as uncompressed messagepack and can be viewed with the following:

```
cat ~/.local/share/rtx/installs/nodejs/18.13.0/.rtxconf.msgpack | msgpack-cli decode
```

### Legacy File Cache

If enabled, rtx will read the legacy filenames such as `.node-version` for
[asdf-nodejs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs). This leverages cache in 2 places where the
plugin is called:

- [`list-legacy-filenames`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs/blob/master/bin/list-legacy-filenames)
    In every plugin I've seen this simply returns a static list of filenamed like ".nvmrc .node-version".
    It's cached alongside the standard "runtime" cache which is refreshed daily by default.
- [`parse-legacy-file`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs/blob/master/bin/parse-legacy-file)
    This plugin binary is called to parse a legacy file to get the version out of it. It's relatively
    expensive so every file that gets parsed as a legacy file is cached into `~/.local/share/rtx/legacy_cache`.
    It will remain cached until the file is modified. This is a simple text file that has the path to the
    legacy file stored as a hash for the filename.
