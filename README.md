<p><em>Polyglot runtime manager (asdf rust clone)</em></p>
</div>

## Features

- **asdf-compatible** - rtx is compatible with asdf plugins and `.tool-versions` files. It can be used as a drop-in replacement. [See below for migration instructions](#how-do-i-migrate-from-asdf)
- **Polyglot** - compatible with any language, so no more figuring out how nvm, nodenv, pyenv, etc work individually—just use 1 tool.
- **Fast** - rtx is written in Rust and is very fast. 20x-200x faster than asdf.
- **No shims** - shims cause problems, they break `which`, and add overhead. By default, rtx
  does not use them—however you can if you want to.
- **Fuzzy matching and aliases** - It's enough to just say you want "v20" of node, or the "lts"
  version. rtx will figure out the right version without you needing to specify an exact version.
- **Arbitrary env vars** - Set custom env vars when in a project directory like `NODE_ENV=production` or `AWS_PROFILE=staging`.

## 30 Second Demo

The following shows using rtx to install different versions
of [node](https://nodejs.org).
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

[![demo](./docs/demo.gif)](./docs/demo.gif)

## Quickstart

Install rtx on macOS (other methods [here](#installation)):

```sh-session
$ curl https://rtx.jdx.dev/rtx-latest-macos-arm64 > ~/bin/rtx
$ chmod +x ~/bin/rtx
$ rtx --version
rtx 2023.12.23
```

Hook rtx into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes rtx is located at ~/bin/rtx
echo 'eval "$(~/bin/rtx activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(~/bin/rtx activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '~/bin/rtx activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

> **Warning**
>
> If you use direnv with `layout python` or other logic that needs to reference rtx runtimes inside
> of an `.envrc`, see the [direnv section](#direnv) below.

Install a runtime and set it as the global default:

```sh-session
$ rtx use --global node@20
$ node -v
v20.0.0
```

## About

_New developer? Try reading the [Beginner's Guide](https://dev.to/jdxcode/beginners-guide-to-rtx-ac4) for a gentler introduction._

rtx is a tool for managing programming language and tool versions. For example, use this to install
a particular version of Node.js and ruby for a project. Using `rtx activate`, you can have your
shell automatically switch to the correct node and ruby versions when you `cd` into the project's
directory[^cd]. Other projects on your machine can use a different set of versions.

rtx is inspired by [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) and uses asdf's vast [plugin ecosystem](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins)
under the hood. However, it is _much_ faster than asdf and has a more friendly user experience.
For more on how rtx compares to asdf, [see below](#comparison-to-asdf).

rtx can be configured in many ways. The most typical is by `.rtx.toml`, but it's also compatible
with asdf `.tool-versions` files. It can also use idiomatic version files like `.node-version` and
`.ruby-version`. See [Configuration](#configuration) for more.

### How it works

rtx hooks into your shell (with `rtx activate zsh`) and sets the `PATH`
environment variable to point your shell to the correct runtime binaries. When you `cd` into a
directory[^cd] containing a `.tool-versions`/`.rtx.toml` file, rtx will automatically set the
appropriate tool versions in `PATH`.

After activating, every time your prompt displays it will call `rtx hook-env` to fetch new
environment variables.
This should be very fast. It exits early if the directory wasn't changed or `.tool-versions`/`.rtx.toml` files haven't been modified.

Unlike asdf which uses shim files to dynamically locate runtimes when they're called, rtx modifies
`PATH` ahead of time so the runtimes are called directly. This is not only faster since it avoids
any overhead, but it also makes it so commands like `which node` work as expected. This also
means there isn't any need to run `asdf reshim` after installing new runtime binaries.

You should note that rtx does not directly install these tools.
Instead, it leverages plugins to install runtimes.
See [plugins](#plugins) below.

[^cd]:
    Note that rtx does not modify "cd". It actually runs every time the prompt is _displayed_.
    See the [FAQ](#what-does-rtx-activate-do).

### Common commands

```text
rtx install node@20.0.0  Install a specific version number
rtx install node@20      Install a fuzzy version number
rtx use node@20          Use node-20.x in current project
rtx use -g node@20       Use node-20.x as global default

rtx install node         Install the current version specified in .tool-versions/.rtx.toml
rtx use node@latest      Use latest node in current directory
rtx use -g node@system   Use system node as global default

rtx x node@20 -- node app.js  Run `node app.js` node-20.x on PATH
```

## Installation

Installing rtx consists of two steps.

1. Download the binary.
   This depends on the device and operating system you are running rtx in.
1. Register a shell hook.
   This depends on the shell you are using.
   Read more about this step in the [FAQ](#what-does-rtx-activate-do).

### Download binary

<details>
  <summary>Standalone</summary>
Note that it isn't necessary for `rtx` to be on `PATH`. If you run the activate script in your rc
file, rtx will automatically add itself to `PATH`.

```
curl https://rtx.jdx.dev/install.sh | sh
```

If you want to verify the install script hasn't been tampered with:

```
gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 0x29DDE9E0
curl https://rtx.jdx.dev/install.sh.sig | gpg --decrypt > install.sh
# ensure the above is signed with the rtx release key
sh ./install.sh
```

or if you're allergic to `| sh`:

```
curl https://rtx.jdx.dev/rtx-latest-macos-arm64 > /usr/local/bin/rtx
```

It doesn't matter where you put it. So use `~/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/share/rtx/bin/rtx`
or whatever.

Supported architectures:

- `x64`
- `arm64`

Supported platforms:

- `macos`
- `linux`

If you need something else, compile it with `cargo install rtx-cli` (see below).
[Windows isn't currently supported.](https://github.com/jdx/rtx/discussions/66)

```
cargo install rtx-cli --git https://github.com/jdx/rtx --branch main
```

</details>
<details>
  <summary>npm</summary>

rtx is available on npm as a precompiled binary. This isn't a Node.js package—just distributed
via npm. This is useful for JS projects that want to setup rtx via `package.json` or `npx`.

### Register shell hook

#### Bash

```
echo 'eval "$(rtx activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Zsh

```
echo 'eval "$(rtx activate zsh)"' >> "${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc"
```

#### Fish

```
echo 'rtx activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

> **Note:**
>
> For homebrew and possibly other installs rtx is automatically activated so
> this is not necessary.
>
> See [`RTX_FISH_AUTO_ACTIVATE=1`](#rtx_fish_auto_activate1) for more information.

#### Nushell

```nushell
do {
  let rtxpath = ($nu.config-path | path dirname | path join "rtx.nu")
  run-external rtx activate nu --redirect-stdout | save $rtxpath -f
  $"\nsource "($rtxpath)"" | save $nu.config-path --append
}
```

#### Xonsh

Since `.xsh` files are [not compiled](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3953) you may shave a bit off startup time by using a pure Python import: add the code below to, for example, `~/.config/xonsh/rtx.py` config file and `import rtx` it in `~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh`:

```xsh
from pathlib         import Path
from xonsh.built_ins import XSH

ctx = XSH.ctx
rtx_init = subprocess.run([Path('~/bin/rtx').expanduser(),'activate','xonsh'],capture_output=True,encoding="UTF-8").stdout
XSH.builtins.execx(rtx_init,'exec',ctx,filename='rtx')
```

Or continue to use `rc.xsh`/`.xonshrc`:

```xsh
echo 'execx($(~/bin/rtx activate xonsh))' >> ~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh # or ~/.xonshrc
```

Given that `rtx` replaces both shell env `$PATH` and OS environ `PATH`, watch out that your configs don't have these two set differently (might throw `os.environ['PATH'] = xonsh.built_ins.XSH.env.get_detyped('PATH')` at the end of a config to make sure they match)

#### Something else?

Adding a new shell is not hard at all since very little shell code is
in this project.
[See here](https://github.com/jdx/rtx/tree/main/src/shell) for how
the others are implemented. If your shell isn't currently supported
I'd be happy to help you get yours integrated.

### Migrate from asdf

If you're moving from asdf to rtx, please review [How do I migrate from asdf?](#how-do-i-migrate-from-asdf) for guidance.

## Uninstalling

Use `rtx implode` to uninstall rtx. This will remove the rtx binary and all of its data. Use
`rtx implode --help` for more information.

Alternatively, manually remove the following directories to fully clean up:

- `~/.local/share/rtx` (can also be `RTX_DATA_DIR` or `XDG_DATA_HOME/rtx`)
- `~/.config/rtx` (can also be `RTX_CONFIG_DIR` or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rtx`)
- on Linux: `~/.cache/rtx` (can also be `RTX_CACHE_DIR` or `XDG_CACHE_HOME/rtx`)
- on macOS: `~/Library/Caches/rtx` (can also be `RTX_CACHE_DIR`)

## Shebang

You can specify a tool and its version in a shebang without needing to first
setup `.tool-versions`/`.rtx.toml` config:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env -S rtx x node@20 -- node
// "env -S" allows multiple arguments in a shebang
console.log(`Running node: ${process.version}`);
```

This can also be useful in environments where rtx isn't activated
(such as a non-interactive session).

## Configuration

### `.rtx.toml`

`.rtx.toml` is a new config file that replaces asdf-style `.tool-versions` files with a file
that has lot more flexibility. It supports functionality that is not possible with `.tool-versions`, such as:

- setting arbitrary env vars while inside the directory
- passing options to plugins like `virtualenv='.venv'` for [python](https://github.com/jdx/rtx/blob/main/docs/python.md#experimental-automatic-virtualenv-creationactivation).
- specifying custom plugin URLs

Here is what an `.rtx.toml` looks like:

```toml
[env]
# supports arbitrary env vars so rtx can be used like direnv/dotenv
NODE_ENV = 'production'

[tools]
# specify single or multiple versions
terraform = '1.0.0'
erlang = ['23.3', '24.0']

# supports everything you can do with .tool-versions currently
node = ['16', 'prefix:20', 'ref:master', 'path:~/.nodes/14']

# send arbitrary options to the plugin, passed as:
# RTX_TOOL_OPTS__VENV=.venv
python = {version='3.10', virtualenv='.venv'}

[plugins]
# specify a custom repo url
# note this will only be used if the plugin does not already exist
python = 'https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-python'

[settings] # project-local settings
verbose = true

[alias.node] # project-local aliases
my_custom_node = '20'
```

`.rtx.toml` files are hierarchical. The configuration in a file in the current directory will
override conflicting configuration in parent directories. For example, if `~/src/myproj/.rtx.toml`
defines the following:

```toml
[tools]
node = '20'
python = '3.10'
```

And `~/src/myproj/backend/.rtx.toml` defines:

```toml
[tools]
node = '18'
ruby = '3.1'
```

Then when inside of `~/src/myproj/backend`, `node` will be `18`, `python` will be `3.10`, and `ruby`
will be `3.1`. You can check the active versions with `rtx ls --current`.

You can also have environment specific config files like `.rtx.production.toml`, see
[Config Environments](#experimental-config-environments) for more details.

#### `[env]` - Arbitrary Environment Variables

The `[env]` section of .rtx.toml allows setting arbitrary environment variables.
These can be simple key-value entries like this:

```toml
[env]
NODE_ENV = 'production'
```

`PATH` is treated specially, it needs to be defined as an array in `env_path`:

```toml
env_path = [
    # adds an absolute path
    "~/.local/share/bin",
    # adds a path relative to the .rtx.toml, not PWD
    "./node_modules/.bin",
]
```

_Note: `env_path` is a top-level key, it does not go inside of `[env]`._

Environment variable values can be templates, see [Templates](#templates) for details.

```toml
[env]
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "/some/path:{{env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}"
```

`env_file` can be used to specify a [dotenv](https://dotenv.org) file to load:

```toml
env_file = '.env'
```

_Note: `env_file` goes at the top of the file, above `[env]`._

```toml
[env]
NODE_ENV = false # unset a previously set NODE_ENV
```

#### `[plugins]` - Specify Custom Plugin Repository URLs

Use `[plugins]` to add/modify plugin shortnames. Note that this will only modify
_new_ plugin installations. Existing plugins can use any URL.

```toml
[plugins]
elixir = "https://github.com/my-org/rtx-elixir.git"
node = "https://github.com/my-org/rtx-node.git#DEADBEEF" # supports specific gitref
```

If you simply want to install a plugin from a specific URL once, it's better to use
`rtx plugin install plugin <GIT_URL>`. Add this section to `.rtx.toml` if you want
to share the plugin location/revision with other developers in your project.

This is similar to [`RTX_SHORTHANDS`](https://github.com/jdx/rtx#rtx_shorthands_fileconfigrtxshorthandstoml)
but doesn't require a separate file.

### Legacy version files

rtx supports "legacy version files" just like asdf. They're language-specific files like `.node-version`
and `.python-version`. These are ideal for setting the runtime version of a project without forcing
other developers to use a specific tool like rtx/asdf.

They support aliases, which means you can have an `.nvmrc` file with `lts/hydrogen` and it will work
in rtx and nvm. Here are some of the supported legacy version files:

| Plugin    | "Legacy" (Idiomatic) Files                         |

| crystal   | `.crystal-version`                                 |

In rtx these are enabled by default. You can disable them with `rtx settings set legacy_version_file false`.
There is a performance cost to having these when they're parsed as it's performed by the plugin in
`bin/parse-version-file`. However these are [cached](#cache-behavior) so it's not a huge deal.
You may not even notice.

### `.tool-versions`

The `.tool-versions` file is asdf's config file and it can be used in rtx just like `.rtx.toml`.
It isn't as flexible so it's recommended to use `.rtx.toml` instead. It can be useful if you
already have a lot of `.tool-versions` files or work on a team that uses asdf.

Here is an example with all the supported syntax:

```
node        20.0.0       # comments are allowed
ruby        3            # can be fuzzy version
shellcheck  latest       # also supports "latest"
jq          1.6
erlang      ref:master   # compile from vcs ref
go          prefix:1.19  # uses the latest 1.19.x version—needed in case "1.19" is an exact match
shfmt       path:./shfmt # use a custom runtime
node        lts          # use lts version of node (not supported by all plugins)

node        sub-2:lts      # install 2 versions behind the latest lts (e.g.: 18 if lts is 20)
python      sub-0.1:latest # install python-3.10 if the latest is 3.11
```

See [the asdf docs](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/configuration.html#tool-versions) for more info on this file format.

### Scopes

Both `.rtx.toml` and `.tool-versions` support "scopes" which modify the behavior of the version:

- `ref:<SHA>` - compile from a vcs (usually git) ref
- `prefix:<PREFIX>` - use the latest version that matches the prefix. Useful for Go since `1.20`
  would only match `1.20` exactly but `prefix:1.20` will match `1.20.1` and `1.20.2` etc.
- `path:<PATH>` - use a custom compiled version at the given path. One use-case is to re-use
  Homebrew tools (e.g.: `path:/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20`).
- `sub-<PARTIAL_VERSION>:<ORIG_VERSION>` - subtracts PARTIAL_VERSION from ORIG_VERSION. This can
  be used to express something like "2 versions behind lts" such as `sub-2:lts`. Or 1 minor
  version behind the latest version: `sub-0.1:latest`.

### Global config: `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`

rtx can be configured in `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`. It's like local `.rtx.toml` files except that
it is used for all directories.

```toml
[tools]
# global tool versions go here
# you can set these with `rtx use -g`
node = 'lts'
python = ['3.10', '3.11']

[settings]
# plugins can read the versions files used by other version managers (if enabled by the plugin)
# for example, .nvmrc in the case of node's nvm
legacy_version_file = true                     # enabled by default (unlike asdf)
legacy_version_file_disable_tools = ['python'] # disable for specific tools

# configure `rtx install` to always keep the downloaded archive
always_keep_download = false        # deleted after install by default
always_keep_install = false         # deleted on failure by default

# configure how frequently (in minutes) to fetch updated plugin repository changes
# this is updated whenever a new runtime is installed
# (note: this isn't currently implemented but there are plans to add it: https://github.com/jdx/rtx/issues/128)
plugin_autoupdate_last_check_duration = '1 week' # set to 0 to disable updates

# config files with these prefixes will be trusted by default
trusted_config_paths = [
    '~/work/my-trusted-projects',
]

verbose = false     # set to true to see full installation output, see `RTX_VERBOSE`
asdf_compat = false # set to true to ensure .tool-versions will be compatible with asdf, see `RTX_ASDF_COMPAT`
jobs = 4            # number of plugins or runtimes to install in parallel. The default is `4`.
raw = false         # set to true to directly pipe plugins to stdin/stdout/stderr
yes = false         # set to true to automatically answer yes to all prompts

shorthands_file = '~/.config/rtx/shorthands.toml' # path to the shorthands file, see `RTX_SHORTHANDS_FILE`
disable_default_shorthands = false # disable the default shorthands, see `RTX_DISABLE_DEFAULT_SHORTHANDS`
disable_tools = ['node']           # disable specific tools, generally used to turn off core tools

experimental = false # enable experimental features

[alias.node]
my_custom_node = '20'  # makes `rtx install node@my_custom_node` install node-20.x
                       # this can also be specified in a plugin (see below in "Aliases")
```

These settings can also be managed with `rtx settings ls|get|set|unset`.

### Environment variables

rtx can also be configured via environment variables. The following options are available:

#### `RTX_DATA_DIR`

Default: `~/.local/share/rtx` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rtx`

This is the directory where rtx stores plugins and tool installs. These are not supposed to be shared
across machines.

#### `RTX_CACHE_DIR`

Default (Linux): `~/.cache/rtx` or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rtx`
Default (macOS): `~/Library/Caches/rtx` or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rtx`

This is the directory where rtx stores internal cache. This is not supposed to be shared
across machines. It may be deleted at any time rtx is not running.

#### `RTX_TMP_DIR`

Default: [`std::env::temp_dir()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.temp_dir.html) implementation in rust

This is used for temporary storage such as when installing tools.

#### `RTX_CONFIG_FILE`

Default: `$RTX_CONFIG_DIR/config.toml` (Usually ~/.config/rtx/config.toml)

This is the path to the config file.

#### `RTX_DEFAULT_TOOL_VERSIONS_FILENAME`

Set to something other than ".tool-versions" to have rtx look for `.tool-versions` files but with
a different name.

#### `RTX_DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILENAME`

Set to something other than `.rtx.toml` to have rtx look for `.rtx.toml` config files with a different name.

#### [experimental] `RTX_ENV`

Enables environment-specific config files such as `.rtx.development.toml`.
Use this for different env vars or different tool versions in
development/staging/production environments. See
[Config Environments](#experimental-config-environments) for more on how
to use this feature.

#### `RTX_USE_VERSIONS_HOST`

Default: `true`

Set to "false" to disable using [rtx-versions](https://rtx-versions.jdx.dev) as
a quick way for rtx to query for new versions. This host regularly grabs all the
latest versions of core and community plugins. It's faster than running a plugin's
`list-all` command and gets around GitHub rate limiting problems when using it.

#### `RTX_${PLUGIN}_VERSION`

Set the version for a runtime. For example, `RTX_NODE_VERSION=20` will use <node@20.x> regardless
of what is set in `.tool-versions`/`.rtx.toml`.

#### `RTX_LEGACY_VERSION_FILE=1`

Plugins can read the versions files used by other version managers (if enabled by the plugin)
for example, `.nvmrc` in the case of node's nvm. See [legacy version files](#legacy-version-files) for more
information.

Set to "0" to disable legacy version file parsing.

#### `RTX_LEGACY_VERSION_FILE_DISABLE_TOOLS=node,python`

Disable legacy version file parsing for specific tools. Separate with `,`.

#### `RTX_USE_TOML=0`

Set to `1` to default to using `.rtx.toml` in `rtx local` instead of `.tool-versions` for
configuration.

For now this is not used by `rtx use` which will only use `.rtx.toml` unless `--path` is specified.

#### `RTX_TRUSTED_CONFIG_PATHS`

This is a list of paths that rtx will automatically mark as
trusted. They can be separated with `:`.

#### `RTX_LOG_LEVEL=trace|debug|info|warn|error`

These change the verbosity of rtx.

You can also use `RTX_DEBUG=1`, `RTX_TRACE=1`, and `RTX_QUIET=1` as well as
`--log-level=trace|debug|info|warn|error`.

#### `RTX_LOG_FILE=~/rtx.log`

Output logs to a file.

#### `RTX_LOG_FILE_LEVEL=trace|debug|info|warn|error`

Same as `RTX_LOG_LEVEL` but for the log _file_ output level. This is useful if you want
to store the logs but not have them litter your display.

#### `RTX_ALWAYS_KEEP_DOWNLOAD=1`

Set to "1" to always keep the downloaded archive. By default it is deleted after install.

#### `RTX_ALWAYS_KEEP_INSTALL=1`

Set to "1" to always keep the install directory. By default it is deleted on failure.

#### `RTX_VERBOSE=1`

This shows the installation output during `rtx install` and `rtx plugin install`.
This should likely be merged so it behaves the same as `RTX_DEBUG=1` and we don't have
2 configuration for the same thing, but for now it is its own config.

Equivalent to `RTX_LOG_LEVEL=debug`.

#### `RTX_QUIET=1`

Equivalent to `RTX_LOG_LEVEL=warn`.

#### `RTX_ASDF_COMPAT=1`

Only output `.tool-versions` files in `rtx local|global` which will be usable by asdf.
This disables rtx functionality that would otherwise make these files incompatible with asdf.

#### `RTX_JOBS=1`

Set the number plugins or runtimes to install in parallel. The default is `4`.

#### `RTX_RAW=1`

Set to "1" to directly pipe plugin scripts to stdin/stdout/stderr. By default stdin is disabled
because when installing a bunch of plugins in parallel you won't see the prompt. Use this if a
plugin accepts input or otherwise does not seem to be installing correctly.

Sets `RTX_JOBS=1` because only 1 plugin script can be executed at a time.

#### `RTX_SHORTHANDS_FILE=~/.config/rtx/shorthands.toml`

Use a custom file for the shorthand aliases. This is useful if you want to share plugins within
an organization.

Shorthands make it so when a user runs something like `rtx install elixir` rtx will
automatically install the [asdf-elixir](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir) plugin. By
default, it uses the shorthands in
[`src/default_shorthands.rs`](./src/default_shorthands.rs).

The file should be in this toml format:

```toml
elixir = "https://github.com/my-org/rtx-elixir.git"
node = "https://github.com/my-org/rtx-node.git"
```

#### `RTX_DISABLE_DEFAULT_SHORTHANDS=1`

Disables the shorthand aliases for installing plugins. You will have to specify full URLs when
installing plugins, e.g.: `rtx plugin install node https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-node.git`

#### `RTX_DISABLE_TOOLS=python,node`

Disables the specified tools. Separate with `,`. Generally used for core plugins but works with
all.

#### `RTX_YES=1`

This will automatically answer yes or no to prompts. This is useful for scripting.

#### `RTX_EXPERIMENTAL=1`

Enables experimental features.

#### `RTX_ALL_COMPILE=1`

Default: false unless running NixOS or Alpine (let me know if others should be added)

Do not use precompiled binaries for all languages. Useful if running on a Linux distrobution
like Alpine that does not use glibc and therefore likely won't be able to run precompiled binaries.

Note that this needs to be setup for each language. File a ticket if you notice a language that is not
working with this config.

#### `RTX_FISH_AUTO_ACTIVATE=1`

Configures the vendor_conf.d script for fish shell to automatically activate.
This file is automatically used in homebrew and potentially other installs to
automatically activate rtx without configuring.

Defaults to enabled, set to "0" to disable.

## Aliases

rtx supports aliasing the versions of runtimes. One use-case for this is to define aliases for LTS
versions of runtimes. For example, you may want to specify `lts-hydrogen` as the version for <node@20.x>
so you can use set it with `node lts-hydrogen` in `.tool-versions`/`.rtx.toml`.

User aliases can be created by adding an `alias.<PLUGIN>` section to `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`:

```toml
[alias.node]
my_custom_20 = '20'
```

Plugins can also provide aliases via a `bin/list-aliases` script. Here is an example showing node.js
versions:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "lts-hydrogen 18"
echo "lts-gallium 16"
echo "lts-fermium 14"
```

> **Note:**
>
> Because this is rtx-specific functionality not currently used by asdf it isn't likely to be in any
> plugin currently, but plugin authors can add this script without impacting asdf users.

## Plugins

rtx uses asdf's plugin ecosystem under the hood. These plugins contain shell scripts like
`bin/install` (for installing) and `bin/list-all` (for listing all of the available versions).

See <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins> for the list of built-in plugins shorthands. See asdf's
[Create a Plugin](https://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html) for how to create your own or just learn
more about how they work.

### Plugin Options

rtx has support for "plugin options" which is configuration specified in `.rtx.toml` to change behavior
of plugins. One example of this is virtualenv on python runtimes:

```toml
[tools]
python = {version='3.11', virtualenv='.venv'}
```

This will be passed to all plugin scripts as `RTX_TOOL_OPTS__VIRTUALENV=.venv`. The user can specify
any option and it will be passed to the plugin in that format.

Currently this only supports simple strings, but we can make it compatible with more complex types
(arrays, tables) fairly easily if there is a need for it.

## Versioning

rtx uses [Calver](https://calver.org/) versioning (`2023.6.1`).
Breaking changes will be few but when they do happen,
they will be communicated in the CLI with plenty of notice whenever possible.

Rather than have SemVer major releases to communicate change in large releases,
new functionality and changes can be opted-into with settings like `experimental = true`.
This way plugin authors and users can
test out new functionality immediately without waiting for a major release.

The numbers in Calver (YYYY.MM.RELEASE) simply represent the date of the release—not compatibility
or how many new features were added.
Each release will be small and incremental.

## Directories

The following are the directories that rtx uses.
These are the default directories, see
[Configuration](#configuration) for information on changing the locations.

> **Tip**
>
> If you often find yourself using these directories (as I do), I suggest setting all of them to `~/.rtx` for easy access.

### `~/.config/rtx`

This directory stores the global configuration file `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`.

### `~/.cache/rtx`

_On macOS this is `~/Library/Caches/rtx`._

Stores internal cache that rtx uses for things like the list of all available versions of a
plugin.
See [Cache Behavior](#cache-behavior) for more information.

### `~/.local/share/rtx`

This is the main directory that rtx uses and is where plugins and tools are installed into.
It is nearly identical to `~/.asdf` in asdf, so much so that you may be able to get by
symlinking these together and using asdf and rtx simultaneously. (Supporting this isn't a
project goal, however).

#### `~/.local/share/rtx/downloads`

This is where plugins may optionally cache downloaded assets such as tarballs. Use the
`always_keep_downloads` setting to prevent rtx from removing files from here.

#### `~/.local/share/rtx/plugins`

rtx installs plugins to this directory when running `rtx plugins install`. If you are working on a
plugin, I suggest
symlinking it manually by running:

```
ln -s ~/src/rtx-my-tool ~/.local/share/rtx/plugins/my-tool
```

#### `~/.local/share/rtx/installs`

This is where tools are installed to when running `rtx install`. For example, `rtx install
node@20.0.0` will install to `~/.local/share/rtx/installs/node/20.0.0`

This will also create other symlinks to this directory for version prefixes ("20" and "20.15")
and matching aliases ("lts", "latest").
For example:

```
20 -> ./20.15.0
20.15 -> ./20.15.0
latest -> ./20.15.0
lts -> ./20.15.0
```

#### `~/.local/share/rtx/shims`

This is where rtx places shims. Generally these are used for IDE integration or if `rtx activate`
does not work for some reason.

## Templates

> **Warning**
>
> This functionality is experimental and may change in the future.

Templates are used in the following locations:

- `.tool-versions` files
- `.rtx.toml` files for most configuration
- _(Submit a ticket if you want to see it used elsewhere!)_

The following context objects are available inside templates:

- `env: HashMap<String, String>` – current environment variables
- `config_root: PathBuf` – directory containing the `.rtx.toml` file

As well as these functions:

- `exec(command: &str) -> String` – execute a command and return the output

Templates are parsed with [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/)—which is quite powerful. For
example, this snippet will get the directory name of the project:

```toml
[env]
PROJECT_NAME = "{{config_root | split(pat='/') | last}}"
```

Here's another using `exec()`:

```toml
[aliases]
current = "{{exec(command='node --version')}}"
```

## [experimental] Config Environments

It's possible to have separate `.rtx.toml` files in the same directory for different
environments like `development` and `production`. To enable, set
`experimental = true` in `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`, then set `RTX_ENV` to an environment like
`development` or `production`. rtx will then look for a `.rtx.{RTX_ENV}.toml` file in the current directory.

rtx will also look for "local" files like `.rtx.local.toml` and `.rtx.{RTX_ENV}.local.toml` in
the current directory. These are intended to not be committed to version control.
(Add `.rtx.local.toml` and `.rtx.*.local.toml` to your `.gitignore` file.)

The priority of these files goes in this order (bottom overrides top):

- `.rtx.toml`
- `.rtx.local.toml`
- `.rtx.{RTX_ENV}.toml`
- `.rtx.{RTX_ENV}.local.toml`

Use `rtx doctor` to see which files are being used.

_Note that currently modifying `RTX_DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILENAME` to something other than `.rtx.toml`
will not work with this feature. For now, it will disable it entirely. This may change in the
future._

## IDE Integration

IDEs work better with shims than they do environment variable modifications. The simplest way is
to add the rtx shim directory to PATH.

For IntelliJ and VSCode—and likely others, you can modify `~/.zprofile`
with the following:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/rtx/shims:$PATH"
```

This won't work for all of rtx's functionality. For example, arbitrary env vars in `[env]` will only be set
if a shim is executed. For this we need tighter integration with the IDE and a custom plugin. If you feel
ambitious, take a look at existing direnv extensions for your IDE and see if you can modify it to work for rtx.
Direnv and rtx work similarly and there should be a direnv extension that can be used as a starting point.

Alternatively, you may be able to get tighter integration with a direnv extension and using the
[`use_rtx`](#direnv) direnv function.

## Core Plugins

rtx comes with some plugins built into the CLI written in Rust. These are new and will improve over
time. They can be easily overridden by installing a plugin with the same name, e.g.: `rtx plugin install python https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-python`.

You can see the core plugins with `rtx plugin ls --core`.

- [Python](./docs/python.md)
- [NodeJS](./docs/node.md)
- [Ruby](./docs/ruby.md)
- [Go](./docs/go.md)
- [Java](./docs/java.md)
- [Deno (experimental)](./docs/deno.md)
- [Bun (experimental)](./docs/bun.md)

## FAQs

### I don't want to put a `.tool-versions` file into my project since git shows it as an untracked file

You can make git ignore these files in 3 different ways:

- Adding `.tool-versions` to project's `.gitignore` file. This has the downside that you need to commit the change to the ignore file.
- Adding `.tool-versions` to project's `.git/info/exclude`. This file is local to your project so there is no need to commit it.
- Adding `.tool-versions` to global gitignore (`core.excludesFile`). This will cause git to ignore `.tool-versions` files in all projects. You can explicitly add one to a project if needed with `git add --force .tool-versions`.

### What is the difference between "nodejs" and "node" (or "golang" and "go")?

These are aliased. For example, `rtx use nodejs@14.0` is the same as `rtx install node@14.0`. This
means it is not possible to have these be different plugins.

This is for convenience so you don't need to remember which one is the "official" name. However if
something with the aliasing is acting up, submit a ticket or just stick to using "node" and "go".
Under the hood, when rtx reads a config file or takes CLI input it will swap out "nodejs" and
"golang".

While this change is rolling out, there is some migration code that will move installs/plugins from
the "nodejs" and "golang" directories to the new names. If this runs for you you'll see a message
but it should not run again unless there is some kind of problem. In this case, it's probably
easiest to just run `rm -rf ~/.local/share/rtx/installs/{golang,nodejs} ~/.local/share/rtx/plugins/{golang,nodejs}`.

Once most users have migrated over this migration code will be removed.

### What does `rtx activate` do?

It registers a shell hook to run `rtx hook-env` every time the shell prompt is displayed.
`rtx hook-env` checks the current env vars (most importantly `PATH` but there are others like
`GOROOT` or `JAVA_HOME` for some tools) and adds/removes/updates the ones that have changed.

For example, if you `cd` into a different directory that has `java 18` instead of `java 17`
specified, just before the next prompt is displayed the shell runs: `eval "$(rtx hook-env)"`
which will execute something like this in the current shell session:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/.local/share/installs/java/18
export PATH=$HOME/.local/share/installs/java/18/bin:$PATH
```

In reality updating `PATH` is a bit more complex than that because it also needs to remove java-17,
but you get the idea.

You may think that is excessive to run `rtx hook-env` every time the prompt is displayed
and it should only run on `cd`, however there are plenty of
situations where it needs to run without the directory changing, for example if `.tool-versions` or
`.rtx.toml` was just edited in the current shell.

Because it runs on prompt display, if you attempt to use `rtx activate` in a
non-interactive session (like a bash script), it will never call `rtx hook-env` and in effect will
never modify PATH because it never displays a prompt. For this type of setup, you can either call
`rtx hook-env` manually every time you wish to update PATH, or use [shims](#shims) instead (preferred).
Or if you only need to use rtx for certain commands, just prefix the commands with
[`rtx x --`](#rtx-exec-options-toolversion----command).
For example, `rtx x -- npm test` or `rtx x -- ./my_script.sh`.

`rtx hook-env` will exit early in different situations if no changes have been made. This prevents
adding latency to your shell prompt every time you run a command. You can run `rtx hook-env` yourself
to see what it outputs, however it is likely nothing if you're in a shell that has already been activated.

`rtx activate` also creates a shell function (in most shells) called `rtx`.
This is a trick that makes it possible for `rtx shell`
and `rtx deactivate` to work without wrapping them in `eval "$(rtx shell)"`.

### `rtx activate` doesn't work in `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zprofile`

`rtx activate` should only be used in `rc` files. These are the interactive ones used when
a real user is using the terminal. (As opposed to being executed by an IDE or something). The prompt
isn't displayed in non-interactive environments so PATH won't be modified.

For non-interactive setups, consider using shims instead which will route calls to the correct
directory by looking at `PWD` every time they're executed. You can also call `rtx exec` instead of
expecting things to be directly on PATH. You can also run `rtx env` in a non-interactive shell, however that
will only setup the global tools. It won't modify the environment variables when entering into a
different project.

Also see the [shebang](#shebang) example for a way to make scripts call rtx to get the runtime.
That is another way to use rtx without activation.

### rtx is failing or not working right

First try setting `RTX_DEBUG=1` or `RTX_TRACE=1` and see if that gives you more information.
You can also set `RTX_LOG_FILE_LEVEL=debug RTX_LOG_FILE=/path/to/logfile` to write logs to a file.

If something is happening with the activate hook, you can try disabling it and calling `eval "$(rtx hook-env)"` manually.
It can also be helpful to use `rtx env` which will just output environment variables that would be set.
Also consider using [shims](#shims) which can be more compatible.

If runtime installation isn't working right, try using the `--raw` flag which will install things in
series and connect stdin/stdout/stderr directly to the terminal. If a plugin is trying to interact
with you for some reason this will make it work.

Of course check the version of rtx with `rtx --version` and make sure it is the latest. Use `rtx self-update`
to update it. `rtx cache clean` can be used to wipe the internal cache and `rtx implode` can be used
to remove everything except config.

Before submitting a ticket, it's a good idea to test what you were doing with asdf. That way we can rule
out if the issue is with rtx or if it's with a particular plugin. For example, if `rtx install python@latest`
doesn't work, try running `asdf install python latest` to see if it's an issue with asdf-python.

Lastly, there is `rtx doctor` which will show diagnostic information and any warnings about issues
detected with your setup. If you submit a bug report, please include the output of `rtx doctor`.

### Windows support?

This is something we'd like to add! <https://github.com/jdx/rtx/discussions/66>

It's not a near-term goal and it would require plugin modifications, but it should be feasible.

### How do I use rtx with http proxies?

Short answer: just set `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables. These should be lowercase.

rtx doesn't really do anything with http itself. The only exception to that is checking for new versions
and `rtx self-update`. It uses `git` to clone plugins and the plugins themselves generally will download
files with `curl` or `wget`.

However this is really up to the plugin. If you're having a proxy-related issue installing something
you should post an issue on the plugin's repository.

### How do the shorthand plugin names map to repositories?

e.g.: how does `rtx plugin install elixir` know to fetch <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir>?

asdf maintains [an index](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins) of shorthands that rtx uses as a base.
This is regularly updated every time that rtx has a release. This repository is stored directly into
the codebase [here](./src/default_shorthands.rs). The bottom of that file contains modifications that
rtx makes on top of asdf.

### Does "node@20" mean the newest available version of node?

It depends on the command. Normally, for most commands and inside of config files, "node@20" will
point to the latest _installed_ version of node-20.x. You can find this version by running
`rtx latest --installed node@20` or by seeing what the `~/.local/share/rtx/installs/node/20` symlink
points to:

```sh-session
$ ls -l ~/.local/share/rtx/installs/node/20
[...] /home/jdx/.local/share/rtx/installs/node/20 -> node-v20.0.0-linux-x64
```

There are some exceptions to this, such as the following:

- `rtx install node@20`
- `rtx latest node@20`
- `rtx upgrade node@20`

These will use the latest _available_ version of node-20.x. This generally makes sense because you
wouldn't want to install a version that is already installed.

### How do I migrate from asdf?

First, just install rtx with `rtx activate` like in the getting started guide and remove asdf from your
shell rc file.

Then you can just run `rtx install` in a directory with an asdf `.tool-versions` file and it will
install the runtimes. You could attempt to avoid this by copying the internal directory from asdf over
to rtx with `cp -r ~/.asdf ~/.local/share/rtx`. That _should_ work because they use the same structure,
however this isn't officially supported or regularly tested. Alternatively you can set `RTX_DATA_DIR=~/.asdf`
and see what happens.

### How compatible is rtx with asdf?

rtx should be able to read/install any `.tool-versions` file used by asdf. Any asdf plugin
should be usable in rtx. The commands in rtx are slightly
different, such as `rtx install node@20.0.0` vs `asdf install node 20.0.0`—this is done so
multiple tools can be specified at once. However, asdf-style syntax is still supported: (`rtx
install node 20.0.0`). This is the case for most commands, though the help for the command may
say that asdf-style syntax is supported.

When in doubt, just try asdf syntax and see if it works. If it doesn't open a ticket. It may
not be possible to support every command identically, but
we should attempt to make things as consistent as possible.

This isn't important for usability reasons so much as making it so plugins continue to work that
call asdf commands.

If you need to switch to/from asdf or work in a project with asdf users, you can set
[`RTX_ASDF_COMPAT=1`](#rtx_asdf_compat1). That prevents
rtx from writing `.tool-versions` files that will not be
compatible with asdf. Also consider using `.rtx.toml` instead which won't conflict with asdf setups.

### rtx isn't working when calling from tmux or another shell initialization script

`rtx activate` will not update PATH until the shell prompt is displayed. So if you need to access a
tool provided by rtx before the prompt is displayed you must manually call `hook-env`:

```bash
eval "$(rtx activate bash)"
eval "$(rtx hook-env)"
python --version # will work only after calling hook-env explicitly
```

For more information, see [What does `rtx activate` do?](#what-does-rtx-activate-do)

### How do I disable/force CLI color output?

rtx uses [console.rs](https://docs.rs/console/latest/console/fn.colors_enabled.html) which
honors the [clicolors spec](https://bixense.com/clicolors/):

- `CLICOLOR != 0`: ANSI colors are supported and should be used when the program isn’t piped.
- `CLICOLOR == 0`: Don’t output ANSI color escape codes.
- `CLICOLOR_FORCE != 0`: ANSI colors should be enabled no matter what.

### Is rtx secure?

Not as much as it should be, though currently a bit more secure than asdf. Work will happen in this area as secure
supply chains are incredibly important. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for more information.

## Comparison to asdf

rtx is mostly a clone of asdf, but there are notable areas where improvements have been made.

### Performance

asdf made (what I consider) a poor design decision to use shims that go between a call to a runtime
and the runtime itself. e.g.: when you call `node` it will call an asdf shim file `~/.asdf/shims/node`,
which then calls `asdf exec`, which then calls the correct version of node.

These shims have terrible performance, adding ~120ms to every runtime call. rtx does not use shims and instead
updates `PATH` so that it doesn't have any overhead when simply calling binaries. These shims are the main reason that I wrote this. Note that in the demo GIF at the top of this README
that `rtx` isn't actually used when calling `node -v` for this reason. The performance is
identical to running node without using rtx.

I don't think it's possible for asdf to fix these issues. The author of asdf did a great writeup
of [performance problems](https://stratus3d.com/blog/2022/08/11/asdf-performance/). asdf is written
in bash which certainly makes it challenging to be performant, however I think the real problem is the
shim design. I don't think it's possible to fix that without a complete rewrite.

rtx does call an internal command `rtx hook-env` every time the directory has changed, but because
it's written in Rust, this is very quick—taking ~10ms on my machine. 4ms if there are no changes, 14ms if it's
a full reload.

tl;dr: asdf adds overhead (~120ms) when calling a runtime, rtx adds a small amount of overhead (~10ms)
when the prompt loads.

### Environment variables in rtx

asdf only helps manage runtime executables. However, some tools are managed via environment variables
(notably Java which switches via `JAVA_HOME`). This isn't supported very well in asdf and requires
a separate shell extension just to manage.

However asdf _plugins_ have a `bin/exec-env` script that is used for exporting environment variables
like [`JAVA_HOME`](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java/blob/master/bin/exec-env). rtx simply exports
the environment variables from the `bin/exec-env` script in the plugin but places them in the shell
for _all_ commands. In asdf it only exports those commands when the shim is called. This means if you
call `java` it will set `JAVA_HOME`, but not if you call some Java tool like `mvn`.

This means we're just using the existing plugin script but because rtx doesn't use shims it can be
used for more things. It would be trivial to make a plugin that exports arbitrary environment
variables like [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) or [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv).

### UX

Some commands are the same in asdf but others have been changed. Everything that's possible
in asdf should be possible in rtx but may use slightly different syntax. rtx has more forgiving commands,
such as using fuzzy-matching, e.g.: `rtx install node@20`. While in asdf you _can_ run
`asdf install node latest:20`, you can't use `latest:20` in a `.tool-versions` file or many other places.
In `rtx` you can use fuzzy-matching everywhere.

asdf requires several steps to install a new runtime if the plugin isn't installed, e.g.:

```sh-session
asdf plugin add node
asdf install node latest:20
asdf local node latest:20
```

In `rtx` this can all be done in a single step to set the local runtime version. If the plugin
and/or runtime needs to be installed it will prompt:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/564031.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/564031)

I've found asdf to be particularly rigid and difficult to learn. It also made strange decisions like
having `asdf list all` but `asdf latest --all` (why is one a flag and one a positional argument?).
`rtx` makes heavy use of aliases so you don't need to remember if it's `rtx plugin add node` or
`rtx plugin install node`. If I can guess what you meant, then I'll try to get rtx to respond
in the right way.

That said, there are a lot of great things about asdf. It's the best multi-runtime manager out there
and I've really been impressed with the plugin system. Most of the design decisions the authors made
were very good. I really just have 2 complaints: the shims and the fact it's written in Bash.

### CI/CD

Using rtx in CI/CD is a great way to synchronize tool versions for dev/build.

### GitHub Actions

rtx is pretty easy to use without an action:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
    - run: |
        curl https://rtx.jdx.dev/install.sh | sh
        echo "$HOME/.local/share/rtx/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
        echo "$HOME/.local/share/rtx/shims" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

Or you can use the custom action [`jdx/rtx-action`](https://github.com/jdx/rtx-action):

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: jdx/rtx-action@v1
      - run: node -v # will be the node version from `.rtx.toml`/`.tool-versions`
```

## Shims

While the PATH design of rtx works great in most cases, there are some situations where shims are
preferable. One example is when calling rtx binaries from an IDE.

To support this, rtx does have a shim dir that can be used. It's located at `~/.local/share/rtx/shims`.

```sh-session
$ rtx i node@20.0.0
$ rtx reshim # may be required if new shims need to be created
$ ~/.local/share/rtx/shims/node -v
v20.0.0
```

## direnv

[direnv](https://direnv.net) and rtx both manage environment variables based on directory. Because they both analyze
the current environment variables before and after their respective "hook" commands are run, they can sometimes conflict with each other.

If you have an issue, it's likely to do with the ordering of PATH. This means it would
really only be a problem if you were trying to manage the same tool with direnv and rtx. For example,
you may use `layout python` in an `.envrc` but also be maintaining a `.tool-versions` file with python
in it as well.

A more typical usage of direnv would be to set some arbitrary environment variables, or add unrelated
binaries to PATH. In these cases, rtx will not interfere with direnv.

### rtx inside of direnv (`use rtx` in `.envrc`)

If you do encounter issues with `rtx activate`, or just want to use direnv in an alternate way,
this is a simpler setup that's less likely to cause issues—at the cost of functionality.

This may be required if you want to use direnv's `layout python` with rtx. Otherwise there are
situations where rtx will override direnv's PATH. `use rtx` ensures that direnv always has control.

To do this, first use `rtx` to build a `use_rtx` function that you can use in `.envrc` files:

```
rtx direnv activate > ~/.config/direnv/lib/use_rtx.sh
```

Now in your `.envrc` file add the following:

```sh-session
use rtx
```

direnv will now call rtx to export its environment variables. You'll need to make sure to add `use_rtx`
to all projects that use rtx (or use direnv's `source_up` to load it from a subdirectory). You can also add `use rtx` to `~/.config/direnv/direnvrc`.

Note that in this method direnv typically won't know to refresh `.tool-versions` files
unless they're at the same level as a `.envrc` file. You'll likely always want to have
a `.envrc` file next to your `.tool-versions` for this reason. To make this a little
easier to manage, I encourage _not_ actually using `.tool-versions` at all, and instead
setting environment variables entirely in `.envrc`:

```
export RTX_NODE_VERSION=20.0.0
export RTX_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
```

Of course if you use `rtx activate`, then these steps won't have been necessary and you can use rtx
as if direnv was not used.

If you continue to struggle, you can also try using the [shims method](#shims).

### Do you need direnv?

While making rtx compatible with direnv is, and will always be a major goal of this project, I also
want rtx to be capable of replacing direnv if needed. This is why rtx includes support for managing
env vars and [virtualenv](https://github.com/jdx/rtx/blob/main/docs/python.md#experimental-automatic-virtualenv-creationactivation)
for python using `.rtx.toml`.

If you find you continue to need direnv, please open an issue and let me know what it is to see if
it's something rtx could support. rtx will never be as capable as direnv with a DSL like `.envrc`,
but I think we can handle enough common use cases to make that unnecessary for most people.

## Cache Behavior

rtx makes use of caching in many places in order to be efficient. The details about how long to keep
cache for should eventually all be configurable. There may be gaps in the current behavior where
things are hardcoded, but I'm happy to add more settings to cover whatever config is needed.

Below I explain the behavior it uses around caching. If you're seeing behavior where things don't appear
to be updating, this is a good place to start.

### Plugin/Runtime Cache

Each plugin has a cache that's stored in `~/$RTX_CACHE_DIR/<PLUGIN>`. It stores
the list of versions available for that plugin (`rtx ls-remote <PLUGIN>`), the legacy filenames (see below),
the list of aliases, the bin directories within each runtime installation, and the result of
running `exec-env` after the runtime was installed.

Remote versions are updated daily by default. The file is zlib messagepack, if you want to view it you can
run the following (requires [msgpack-cli](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-cli)).

```sh-session
cat ~/$RTX_CACHE_DIR/node/remote_versions.msgpack.z | perl -e 'use Compress::Raw::Zlib;my $d=new Compress::Raw::Zlib::Inflate();my $o;undef $/;$d->inflate(<>,$o);print $o;' | msgpack-cli decode
```

Note that the caching of `exec-env` may be problematic if the script isn't simply exporting
static values. The vast majority of `exec-env` scripts only export static values, but if you're
working with a plugin that has a dynamic `exec-env` submit
a ticket and we can try to figure out what to do.

Caching `exec-env` massively improved the performance of rtx since it requires calling bash
every time rtx is initialized. Ideally, we can keep this
behavior.

<!-- RTX:COMMANDS -->

## Commands

### `rtx activate [OPTIONS] [SHELL_TYPE]`

```text
Initializes rtx in the current shell

This should go into your shell's rc file.
Otherwise, it will only take effect in the current session.
(e.g. ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc)

This is only intended to be used in interactive sessions, not scripts.
rtx is only capable of updating PATH when the prompt is displayed to the user.
For non-interactive use-cases, use shims instead.

Typically this can be added with something like the following:

    echo 'eval "$(rtx activate)"' >> ~/.zshrc

However, this requires that "rtx" is in your PATH. If it is not, you need to
specify the full path like this:

    echo 'eval "$(/path/to/rtx activate)"' >> ~/.zshrc

Usage: activate [OPTIONS] [SHELL_TYPE]

Arguments:
  [SHELL_TYPE]
          Shell type to generate the script for

          [possible values: bash, fish, nu, xonsh, zsh]

Options:
      --status
          Show "rtx: <PLUGIN>@<VERSION>" message when changing directories

Examples:
  $ eval "$(rtx activate bash)"
  $ eval "$(rtx activate zsh)"
  $ rtx activate fish | source
  $ execx($(rtx activate xonsh))

 20.0.0
```

### `rtx alias ls [PLUGIN]`

```text
List aliases
Shows the aliases that can be specified.
These can come from user config or from plugins in `bin/list-aliases`.

For user config, aliases are defined like the following in `~/.config/rtx/config.toml`:

  [alias.node]
  lts = "20.0.0"

Usage: alias ls [PLUGIN]

Arguments:
  [PLUGIN]
          Show aliases for <PLUGIN>

Examples:
  $ rtx aliases

  $ rtx alias set node lts-hydrogen 18.0.0
```

### `rtx alias unset <PLUGIN> <ALIAS>`

```text
Clears an alias for a plugin

This modifies the contents of ~/.config/rtx/config.toml

Usage: alias unset <PLUGIN> <ALIAS>

Usage: cache clear
```

### `rtx completion [SHELL]`

```text
Generate shell completions

Usage: completion [SHELL]

Arguments:
  [SHELL]
          Shell type to generate completions for

          [possible values: bash, fish, zsh]

Examples:
  $ rtx completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/rtx
  $ rtx completion zsh  > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_rtx
  $ rtx completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rtx.fish
```

### `rtx current [PLUGIN]`

```text
Shows current active and installed runtime versions

This is similar to `rtx ls --current`, but this only shows the runtime
and/or version. It's designed to fit into scripts more easily.

Usage: current [PLUGIN]

Arguments:
  [PLUGIN]
          Plugin to show versions of e.g.: ruby, node

Examples:
  # outputs `.tool-versions` compatible format
  $ rtx current
  python 3.11.0 3.10.0
  shfmt 3.6.0
  shellcheck 0.9.0
  node 20.0.0

  $ rtx current node
  20.0.0

  # can output multiple versions
  $ rtx current python
  3.11.0 3.10.0
```

### `rtx deactivate`

```text
Disable rtx for current shell session

This can be used to temporarily disable rtx in a shell session.

Usage: deactivate

Examples:
  $ rtx deactivate bash
  $ rtx deactivate zsh
  $ rtx deactivate fish
  $ execx($(rtx deactivate xonsh))
```

### `rtx direnv activate`

```text
Output direnv function to use rtx inside direnv

See https://github.com/jdx/rtx#direnv for more information

Because this generates the legacy files based on currently installed plugins,
you should run this command after installing new plugins. Otherwise
direnv may not know to update environment variables when legacy file versions change.

Usage: direnv activate

Examples:
  $ rtx direnv activate > ~/.config/direnv/lib/use_rtx.sh
  $ echo 'use rtx' > .envrc
  $ direnv allow

  $ rtx doctor
  [WARN] plugin node is not installed
```

### `rtx env [OPTIONS] [TOOL@VERSION]...`

  [TOOL@VERSION]...
          Tool(s) to use

Options:

  $ eval "$(rtx env -s bash)"
  $ eval "$(rtx env -s zsh)"
  $ rtx env -s fish | source
  $ execx($(rtx env -s xonsh))
```

### `rtx env-vars [OPTIONS] [ENV_VARS]...`

```text
Manage environment variables

By default this command modifies ".rtx.toml" in the current directory.
You can specify the file name by either setting the RTX_DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILENAME environment variable, or by using the --file option.

Usage: env-vars [OPTIONS] [ENV_VARS]...

Arguments:
  [ENV_VARS]...
          Environment variable(s) to set
          e.g.: NODE_ENV=production

Options:
      --file <FILE>
          The TOML file to update

          Defaults to RTX_DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILENAME environment variable, or ".rtx.toml".

      --remove <ENV_VAR>
          Remove the environment variable from config file

          Can be used multiple times.
```

### `rtx exec [OPTIONS] [TOOL@VERSION]... [-- <COMMAND>...]`

```text
Execute a command with tool(s) set

use this to avoid modifying the shell session or running ad-hoc commands with rtx tools set.

Tools will be loaded from .rtx.toml/.tool-versions, though they can be overridden with <RUNTIME> args
Note that only the plugin specified will be overridden, so if a `.tool-versions` file
includes "node 20" but you run `rtx exec python@3.11`; it will still load node@20.

The "--" separates runtimes from the commands to pass along to the subprocess.

Usage: exec [OPTIONS] [TOOL@VERSION]... [-- <COMMAND>...]

Arguments:
  [TOOL@VERSION]...
          Tool(s) to start e.g.: node@20 python@3.10

  [COMMAND]...
          Command string to execute (same as --command)

Options:
  -c, --command <C>
          Command string to execute

  -C, --cd <CD>
          Change to this directory before executing the command

Examples:
  $ rtx exec node@20 -- node ./app.js  # launch app.js using node-20.x
  $ rtx x node@20 -- node ./app.js     # shorter alias

  # Specify command as a string:
  $ rtx exec node@20 python@3.11 --command "node -v && python -V"

  # Run a command in a different directory:
  $ rtx x -C /path/to/project node@20 -- node ./app.js
```

### `rtx implode [OPTIONS]`

```text
Removes rtx CLI and all related data

Skips config directory by default.

Usage: implode [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --config
          Also remove config directory

  -n, --dry-run
          List directories that would be removed without actually removing them
```

### `rtx install [OPTIONS] [TOOL@VERSION]...`

```text
Install a tool version

This will install a tool version to `~/.local/share/rtx/installs/<PLUGIN>/<VERSION>`
It won't be used simply by being installed, however.
For that, you must set up a `.rtx.toml`/`.tool-version` file manually or with `rtx use`.
Or you can call a tool version explicitly with `rtx exec <TOOL>@<VERSION> -- <COMMAND>`.

Tools will be installed in parallel. To disable, set `--jobs=1` or `RTX_JOBS=1`

Usage: install [OPTIONS] [TOOL@VERSION]...

Arguments:
  [TOOL@VERSION]...
          Tool(s) to install e.g.: node@20

Options:
  -f, --force
          Force reinstall even if already installed

  -v, --verbose...
          Show installation output

Examples:
  $ rtx install node@20.0.0  # install specific node version
  $ rtx install node@20      # install fuzzy node version
  $ rtx install node         # install version specified in .tool-versions or .rtx.toml
  $ rtx install                # installs everything specified in .tool-versions or .rtx.toml
```

### `rtx latest [OPTIONS] <TOOL@VERSION>`

```text
Gets the latest available version for a plugin

Usage: latest [OPTIONS] <TOOL@VERSION>

Arguments:
  <TOOL@VERSION>
          Tool to get the latest version of

Options:
  -i, --installed
          Show latest installed instead of available version

Examples:
  $ rtx latest node@20  # get the latest version of node 20
  20.0.0

  $ rtx latest node     # get the latest stable version of node
  20.0.0
```

### `rtx link [OPTIONS] <TOOL@VERSION> <PATH>`

```text
Symlinks a tool version into rtx

Use this for adding installs either custom compiled outside
rtx or built with a different tool.

Usage: link [OPTIONS] <TOOL@VERSION> <PATH>

Arguments:
  <TOOL@VERSION>
          Tool name and version to create a symlink for

  <PATH>

### `rtx reshim`

```text
rebuilds the shim farm

This creates new shims in ~/.local/share/rtx/shims for CLIs that have been added.
rtx will try to do this automatically for commands like `npm i -g` but there are
other ways to install things (like using yarn or pnpm for node) that rtx does
not know about and so it will be necessary to call this explicitly.

If you think rtx should automatically call this for a particular command, please
open an issue on the rtx repo. You can also setup a shell function to reshim
automatically (it's really fast so you don't need to worry about overhead):

npm() {
  command npm "$@"
  rtx reshim
}

  $ rtx reshim
  $ ~/.local/share/rtx/shims/node -v
  v20.0.0
