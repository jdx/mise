# Test that mise handles environment variables with non-ASCII/invalid UTF-8 gracefully
# This reproduces the bug where invalid UTF-8 environment variables cause mise to panic

# Test 1: Non-MISE environment variables with special characters should not cause panics
export SOME_VAR_WITH_UNICODE="Ü Ä Ö ß à é"
export HOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE="✅"

# Basic commands should work without panicking
assert "mise --version"
assert "mise env"

# Test 2: MISE_*_VERSION variables with Unicode should work
export MISE_NODE_VERSION="20.0.0"
export MISE_PYTHON_VERSION="3.11"

assert "mise env"

# Test 3: Test with actual command that was reported in bug
# This should not panic (may fail due to network but shouldn't panic)
